# Introduction

Always Be Learning

At the age of fourteen my parents sent me to several weeks of sleepaway computer camp. It was every bit as geeky as you're picturing in your head: rows of folding tables with dozens of (mostly) young boys glued to their gray CRT monitors, paying more attention to the game Unreal Tournament than to their programming lessons. Two years later, at sixteen, I went back to computer camp as a counselor/programming teacher, and I loved every minute of it. I was very lucky that, at a young age, I recognized and my parents supported my love of computers and software programming.

Fast forward another few years to the summer before my freshman year at the University of Pennsylvania. I knew for sure I wanted to study computer science as an undergraduate, but I also had the idea in my head that I liked business. My father had started his own business, my brother had just graduated business school, so business seemed like a great idea. Penn is known for their dual degree programs that let students graduate with degrees in multiple fields, like engineering and business.

That prospect seemed perfect to my eighteen-year-old self, so I emailed my advisor, Dr. Max Mintz, and dutifully set up a meeting to discuss my application for the dual degree program. Being an incredibly generous and student-focused professor, Dr. Mintz graciously agreed and invited me down to Philadelphia to talk about it over a cup of coffee at Tuscany Cafe.

On the chosen day, having driven three hours from New York to Philadelphia, I sat down across from Dr. Mintz, eager to hear how to game the system. I figured it was a matter of choosing the right classes and getting sufficiently good grades to qualify. Dr Mintz, however, had other ideas.

Full of anticipation and ready to take instructions on how to polish my résumé I took a sip of my coffee and asked him: how do I get into the dual degree program? The man I would soon come to know only as Max picked up a napkin and drew an X-Y axis on it, then looked me in the eye and asked me if I knew what special relativity was. I wish I had a video of that moment, as I imagine my face contorted into a rather amusing shape. Before I could finish my answer, Max was off to the races. For the next two hours he proceeded to introduce me to Einstein's theories. By the time we had finished, my brain was broken, and not once did we get to discuss anything about Penn's dual degree programs.

We had several more coffees over the coming months, and any time I'd ask Max about an application or a résumé, he'd steer me right back into real science. Max wanted me to *learn* not just to absorb whatever topic he was lecturing about at the moment, but to get really good at learning, and learning hard things at that. Max couldn't care less what piece of paper his students were given at the end of their four years as long as each of them was prepared to continue learning for the rest of their lives.

By the time I graduated college, Max had become a close friend and confidant, and he had fundamentally shaped the path of my education. Rather than give me fish, Max handed me a fishing pole and taught me how to attach bait and cast a line.

No single book can give you the experience Max gave me as an undergraduate student. I make no such promises for the book you're reading now. Instead, I tell this story to emphasize the value and impact of a focus on the fundamentals of learning itself.

As a technical leader, the desire, willingness, and aptitude to continue learning are critical to your success. There is far too much tech knowledge out there for anybody to become a true expert in everything needed to work in modern technology. I like thinking of a person pursuing a career in tech as a character in an RPG game that, rather than killing enemies to level up, must spend forty hours a week at a job collecting skill points. You get to choose the skill trees on which to spend the accumulated points, but you need to choose wisely. The variety of skill trees is vast enough that it's impossible to unlock all of them, so you must specialize.

The most wonderful thing about tech is that our field is continuously evolving. The people you work with will change. The tools you use will be updated or deprecated, and new techniques for doing your work will come and go. As you embark on your adventure in technical leadership, the only way to manage this change is to expect it, accept it, and embrace the opportunity to learn and grow with your team and the field itself.

> I want people to be serious about learning. I want them to dig in. I want them to gain, most importantly. It's not RSA, it's not [nuanced algorithms]; those aren't important. It's that confidence in themselves they can grow and learn outside of academia: that means they don't need me. All they need is to be able to sit down with books or perhaps today the internet and go off and learn things on their own.

The Startup Technical Leader's Dilemma

Most startups have a technical cofounder. This person writes the bulk of the initial codebase, hires the first few engineers, and runs the technical show for the startup at least through their first one or two rounds of funding.

Somewhere between hiring the third and tenth engineer, this person will stop being hands on keyboard and start spending all their time managing the team. At this point, problems often arise: the team begins shipping features more slowly, the defect rate begins to climb, system stability may suffer, overall costs go up, and the other founders start to worry.

Chances are the technical cofounder, or any technical leader, has spent their entire career up to this point investing their time and effort in becoming a great programmer, not into developing leadership skills. It should come as no surprise then, with their leadership skills at level 1, that they're making mistakes and costing the company time and money.

Regardless of your title and when you joined the company, if you've devoted most of your career and experience to technology and you're now assuming responsibility for people or a department, it's critical you realize that you're now in a leadership role; your technical background and talents won't be enough on their own to be successful. While some technical skills are table stakes for running a software engineering team, the reality is, to do a good job as a leader you need to focus on people leadership, management, architecture, and general decision-making skills.

People leadership isn't for everyone. I'm sure you've heard stories of technical founders who stepped aside as their companies grew. Steve Wozniak, cofounder of Apple, is perhaps the most famous example of this pattern. There is no shame in stepping aside; Wozniak recognized that technical work was what he loved, and that is where he wanted to spend his time. You would do well to at least consider the same for yourself: decide if programming is your zone of genius and the work that gives you the most joy. If it is, you'll have a great career ahead climbing to the ranks of the most senior technical staff.

If, however, you or your circumstances have led you to conclude that managing or leading a team is the role you aspire to, then this handbook will provide a good starting point on how to broaden your skills on the journey to becoming a successful technical leader.

## The Author

I had my very first startup experience during the summer after my freshman year of college. I have no memory of why I sought out an internship at Eduware, or why they accepted my application. What I do remember is commuting every morning to work in a tiny room in the back of a first- floor office with four other young software engineers. The oldest of us must have been twenty-five; I was nineteen. It was just the five of us sitting around a horseshoe-shaped table, working shoulder to shoulder on a .NET education application. I was probably useless as an engineer, but I was fortunate that the oldest and most senior engineer of the group took the time to teach me and help me understand the tools, and I gradually became more productive.

Something about that experience in a stuffy room at the back of the office must have left a good impression on me, as I've chosen to work at seven more startups since: Invite Media, WiFast (now Adentro), SoChat, AutoLotto, Trellis Technologies, GrowFlow, and Equi. At Invite Media, a display advertising and exchange bidding company, I partnered with the CTO to lead a rapid growth phase that culminated in its 2010 acquisition by Google for $81 million. At Google I took over site reliability responsibilities for Invite's departing CTO and oversaw the company's integration into Google's stack.

From there I went on to cofound WiFast, a tech company focused on democratizing and monetizing Wi-Fi usage, serving as both CEO and CTO through our first two major funding rounds. I've also served as Entrepreneur-in-Residence at Tencent in Guangzhou, China, and cofounded SoChat, a cross-platform messaging app. Since then, I've served as CTO at Lottery.com, Trellis Technologies, GrowFlow (acquired by Dama Financial), and Equi.

I've approached each of these roles with a founder's mentality, working to establish creative environments and advance the idea that engineering software should be more science than art.

I've also been fortunate to learn from others throughout this journey, including seven teams of fantastic engineers, countless consulting/coaching clients, and many brilliant cofounders. I've also proactively sought to elevate my own leadership via years of management coaching from one of Silicon Valley's top coaches, as well as tapping countless mentors and reading hundreds of relevant books.

Through my reading, it's become clear to me that while there are hundreds of how-to books for programmers and people working with specific tech or tools, and dozens of helpful books for CEOs and CFOs on the financial side of entrepreneurship, one thing our industry is missing is a thorough, practical resource for startup tech leaders. We need a resource that covers all the topics in between the core skills, and addresses the range of leadership challenges and skills so critical to our role.

There are also plenty of blogs on how to write good code, or how to run user surveys, or on finding product market fit. This is a book on technical team building; it addresses all the skills a leader needs to build a company that they didn't learn in traditional tech education or experience.

## Using this Book

As a leader of a software engineering team, chances are you've encountered some of these issues in your role:

* Tracking, managing, or paying down tech debt.

* Hiring, attracting, cultivating, and retaining top talent.

* Creating an objective, fair, and transparent performance review system.

* Building, managing, and sustaining a healthy and generative company culture.

* Navigating your relationships with other leaders at your company.

* Enduring slow decision-making or endless circular arguments among technical staff about how to architect and build your system.

It would seem that every technical leader faces these issues at one time or another, and yet advice on how to handle them is inconveniently left out of nearly every business or technical curriculum.

My aim is to provide perspective on these problems and more, as well as offer context on how various techniques play out in the real world. The goal is to arm the reader with an understanding of the tradeoffs, some visibility to see around the corner, and frameworks that will prepare you to make your own well-reasoned decisions.

This book is written primarily for anybody who is presently or may in the future find themselves managing a software engineering team, particularly as the driving force of a venture-backed startup. It may also prove useful for individual contributors non-manager software engineers as a means to gain perspective into the kinds of tasks and demands placed on managers that may not be obvious at first glance.

I've formatted this book as a collection of independent chapters covering a broad spectrum of topics. It is intended to be used as a reference guide, for the reader to pick up a chapter as it becomes helpful and not necessarily read sequentially from start to finish. For this reason, some material is repeated in various chapters to ensure that each chapter can stand on its own without the benefit of the prior sections as context.

My goal in each chapter is not to provide an exhaustive discussion or review on the topic. Instead, the goal is to introduce the topic, provide an overview or a structure for thinking about it, offer some best practices, and suggest reference material to explore the subject more deeply. Think of this book as a breadth-first collection of topics related to technical leadership. It's up to the reader to determine which topics are most interesting to them, and, equipped with some context and perspective, do a deep dive on what's most relevant and put the knowledge into practice.

At the end of the day this book is a synthesis of my personal experience and the resources I've found helpful, interspersed with advice and input from peers, mentors, and advisors. If there are things in this book you disagree with or believe are incorrect that you'd like to let me know about, or if you find this book helpful and would like to communicate with me directly, feel free to reach out at zach@ctohb.com. I'm also happy to discuss advising, coaching, and mentorship opportunities at the same address.

# Business Processes

Throughout this book you'll find many descriptions of business processes. My goal in outlining these processes is to provide a starting point for how you might implement a solution to a problem you are facing.

Depending on the size of your team and company, what is described here might appear overly burdening and cumbersome, or it might seem too sparse and unsophisticated to address your needs. The reality is that, as your company and team grow, you will need to reinvent the ways you do business. Your company of five people will operate very differently when it grows to twenty or fifty or a hundred or a thousand. I've highlighted the core principles that matter and left it to you to adapt them to your team as it's constituted now, and also to scale your approach as the needs and constraints of your business change in the future.
