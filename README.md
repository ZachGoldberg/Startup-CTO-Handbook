*NOTE:* As of October 2023 I'm still working on porting the book content into markdown. Everything is in there (via a .doc to .md auto-converter) but the formatting is all over the place and needs a lot of cleanup still, apologies for my mess in the interim!

# The Book
You can view the latest content of the book in markdown [here](startup_cto_handbook/)

You can buy the book on [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1955811563)
