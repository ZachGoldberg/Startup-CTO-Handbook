*NOTE:* As of October 2023 I'm still working on porting the book content into markdown. Everything is in there (via a .doc to .md auto-converter) but the formatting is all over the place and needs a lot of cleanup still, apologies for my mess in the interrum!

# The Book!
You can view the latest content of the book in markdown [here](StartupCTOHandbook.md)

You can buy the book on [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1955811563)

(Coming Soon) Link of the latest version of the markdown rendered to PDF

The original manuscript (now outdated) can be found as a [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/147KVarJdNQ2ZdmDHOSsd7W39anejRu2NfxEWCzwl0IU/edit)
