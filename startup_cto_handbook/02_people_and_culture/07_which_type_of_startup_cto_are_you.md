## Which Type of Startup CTO Are You?

Whether you're the CTO, a CEO playing the role of CTO, or a founder hoping to hire a CTO, it's helpful to have a clear understanding of what exactly it is a CTO does in a startup, and how that role differs from executive and leadership roles in more established companies. As with most things, the answer depends on context and will change over time. Calvin French-Owen has

a great article (ctohb.com/founder2cto) breaking down the CTO into four archetypes: People Leader, Architect, R&D, and Marketing/Consumer- facing. I like this breakdown and will refine it a bit here to three types:

* Tech-Focused

* People-Focused

* Externally Focused

### The Tech-Focused CTO *AKA The Chief Architect*

The tech-focused CTO may also be the office of the CTO, leading an internal technical skunkworks whose primary output is forward-thinking strategy, architecture, and sometimes proof-of-concept implementation on how to help the business down the road. is CTO will have fewer reports, with the bulk of the engineering organization reporting to a separate vice president of engineering. In this case, it's not uncommon for the vice president of engineering (VPE) to report to somebody other than the CTO most commonly, directly to a CEO or to a chief product officer (CPO).

The internal tech-focused CTO may also be the chief technical process architect, setting up tools, systems, and processes for how technical work gets done.

As an internal tech-focused CTO, you may also function as a product manager if your company's product is highly technical in nature (i.e., developer tools, API-as-a-service, etc.)

### The People-Focused CTO *AKA the VP of Engineering (VPE)*

A typical startup will not have both a VPE and a CTO, and so it often falls on the CTO to fill the VPE role. This is often also the hardest role for a cofounder CTO to fill, as the responsibilities of the day one technical cofounder don't much overlap with the responsibilities of the internally people-focused technical leader.

The people-focused CTO is responsible for setting internal technical culture, the hiring process, and overseeing internal processes. is CTO spends much of their time actually managing either independent contributors or other technical managers. This is the most critical of the three focus areas to get right. If a company isn't hiring well, or its technical staff is poorly managed, unmotivated, unfocused, or not aligned, it can impact productivity, and even lead to bad decision-making that will hurt the organization in the long term.

### The Externally Focused CTO *AKA The Head of Technical Sales/Marketing*

This is likely the least common focus for a startup CTO, but no less critical at the right time or place. Most often, you see this CTO at companies that build products for a technical audience developer tools, for example. These CTOs spend lots of time writing blog articles or speaking at conferences. Perhaps they are brought into sales meetings to act as an executive technical representative to close large deals. Note that building a brand around the technical team not only has a positive effect on product sales, but also can be a great recruiting tool and can reduce your time and cost of hires.

This is perhaps the easiest role for the founder CTO to step into, as they have the historical context for the company and can most genuinely and passionately tell the company story and evangelize its product and value.

#### Transitioning Between Types

Ideally, a startup CTO will prove adept in all three areas, though most people will specialize in just one or two. If your business needs a focus that isn't your expertise, it may be worth asking yourself if you can execute that task more effectively by delegating it to a coworker. Especially at an early stage startup, most technical cofounder/cofounder CTOs will be internal tech-focused. Usually There'snot much other work to be done at this stage!

It's a very common pattern for that person to find themselves stretching into internal people or external focuses as the company grows, and that's not always a desirable transition for that person. It's not a personal failure to admit that your specialty or your motivation is in tech and that people management isn't a great fit, but quite the opposite. Identifying your superpowers and architecting a role in the company to leverage that superpower is how you add the most value, and the company should hire somebody else whose superpower is, for example, people management to fill that role.

If you find yourself stuck in a role you're unhappy with, it's vital that you acknowledge the mismatch both to yourself and to your CEO. is doesn't mean giving up your position as a founder or leader, or as a respected and high-impact person within the company.

Some thoughts on various transitions:

* Your Superpower: Internal Tech
  * Company Needs
    * Internal People: Hire a people-focused VP of Engineering, proactively characterizing the role of CTO as technical.

    * External Focus: If you don't already have somebody in-house who is doing this better than you, then hire a developer evangelist and empower them to fulfill the role. Otherwise, promote from within and ensure it's clear what the role entails.

* Your Superpower: Internal People
  * Company Needs

    * Internal Tech: If you have a senior engineer or architect on the team whom you can empower/elevate to a position of technical leadership, that's worth considering. Otherwise, a technical architect should be near the top of your hiring priorities.

    * External Focus: If you don't already have somebody in-house who is doing this better than you, then hire a developer evangelist and empower them to fulfill the role. Otherwise, promote from within and ensure it's clear what the role entails.

* Your Superpower: External Focus
  * Company Needs
    * Internal Tech: If you have a senior engineer or architect on the team who you can empower/elevate to a position of technical leadership, that's worth considering. Otherwise, a technical architect should be near the top of your hiring priorities.
    * Internal People: Hire a people-focused VP of Engineering.

In many cases, the end outcome may mean hiring a CTO whose superpower is better aligned with what the company needs at the time. In other cases, it might mean hiring a very capable people-focused VP of Engineering to complement a highly technical CTO.
