## Hiring and Interviewing

Hiring effectively is one of your highest-impact activities as a technical leader and one of the most challenging to get right. You will often find yourself trying to recruit talent in a supply-constrained market and competing against other companies that might have deeper pockets than yours. Your top candidates will likely receive other competing job offers, which means you not only need to qualify candidates but convince them that your opportunity is the right one for them.

In that way, hiring is as much a sales activity (where candidates qualify you/your company) as it is a filtering process (you/your company qualifies the candidates). It's important to keep this in mind every step of the way as you define your team's hiring processes.

This section of the book covers the various sections of the hiring and interviewing journey, sequentially, from headcount planning to onboarding.

### Hire like a Startup

As a startup, you have several key advantages in hiring, and it's critical you leverage those in the process to ensure you can attract top talent. A few features that give you an edge:

* You're smaller, meaning you should also be more nimble, higher-touch, and faster to hire than large competition.

* You can sell a highly compelling company and personal growth trajectory. You can sell a creative and inspiring workplace culture.

* You can sell the impact that successful candidates will make.

* You can offer meaningful equity ownership in the company and thus the ability to share in the upside of the company's success.

Here are some practical tips for leveraging these advantages:

* To move fast, train and enlist coworkers for interviews before posting the job description. Make sure that everyone understands the scheduling process, the interview scripts, and scoring criteria, and how to use the Applicant Tracking Software (ATS) to read and leave feedback before you even get started (see Sourcing Candidates, page 59).

* Schedule all the interviews with each candidate upfront. If your process includes four interviews, get all four on the calendar at the start, ideally within five business days. If your team is quick about leaving their interview feedback (and you should insist that they are), then you can give any candidates that fail out early notice and cancel any pending calendar invitations. The alternative scheduling subsequent interviews only after a candidate passes each round adds multiple days in between each step, easily turning what could be a week-long process into three weeks or more.

* A good rule of thumb, especially at a startup: nobody is too busy or too important to make themselves available to meet with candidates if it makes sense for them to do so, especially for more senior hires. If a strong candidate asks to talk to your CEO and COO, then you should schedule meetings with them.

* Ensure that each interviewer has a unique script or guide that covers different material, or material from a different angle than other interviews. (For more detail on this, see the Ask Only New Questions section of Interviewing Best Practices, page 63.)

As ever, there is no free lunch, and the benefits of hiring as a startup also come with tradeoffs, primarily in the form of risk. Candidates are almost certain to ask you questions about your company's product market fit, cash on hand or runway, company culture, and work/life balance. I encour age you to be candid with candidates about these factors, work with your executive team on the facts on the ground, and have good answers to these questions when asked.

### Speed is Your Friend!

Remember, speed is your friend when recruiting top talent. If you can move somebody through your full process in a week, you give your startup a major advantage against larger companies whose processes often take months to arrive at a decision.

### WHEN TO HIRE: HEADCOUNT PLANNING

Cash is the lifeblood of a young and not-yet-profitable startup, so the decision to commit to a recurring $100,000-plus a year expense in the form of a new engineer's salary should not be taken lightly. Several key factors contribute to headcount decisions, foremost among them need, prioritization, timing, and budget.

#### ROLE NEED/TEAM GAP

The first step toward deciding to hire is identifying a gap in the team. Gaps come in several forms. Commonly, at an early stage in a company's development, it's simply a skill gap. For example, your business decides that mobile apps are going to be a key element of your go-to-market strategy, and your founding team has never worked in mobile before. Certainly, they could learn and become effective over time, but it would be far more efficient in both the short and long term to hire a senior engineer who has experience in and desire to work on mobile to build and maintain that project.

Other kinds of gaps include seniority gaps (not enough senior experience to make good decisions, or not enough junior talent to handle less complex tasks), management gaps (one manager responsible for too many people), or subject matter expertise gaps (no one on the team who understands an area of the industry well enough to guide decision-making).

The other major justification for a hire is to increase total bandwidth on a team. These kinds of hires should be aligned with some kind of business objective, or product roadmap, that justifies bringing on a new permanent team member at a given time.

#### ROLE PRIORITIZATION AND TIMING

Once you've identified a gap, the next question to ask is when that gap needs to be filled. Taking into account the lead time required to get a great hire, when does it make sense to start the hiring process?

Often though not always the answer is right now! Every new person you hire adds complexity and overhead to your team. Assuming the pain of having the gap isn't severe, if you can get away with a smaller team for another six months and delay the hire, that can be a good idea as it both reduces cost and gives you more time to build a case for the hire.

Headcount or hiring requests from your team will often have to compete with requests from other teams, so it's useful to develop a common language across your company for discussing how urgent or important a hire is. is doesn't have to be very sophisticated; it could be a 0 5 ranking system, where a 0 represents an urgent need, and a 5 a hire that would be nice to have but can wait a few months or quarters before becoming urgent.

#### BUDGETING FOR NEW HIRES

At an unprofitable startup, you should have a financial model that rationalizes expenses vs. revenue and forecasts roughly how long your current cash on hand will last before you need another fundraising round. Most CEOs and CFOs have a deep and intimate understanding of this model; as a tech leader, you won't need to spend nearly as much time with it.

However, it's essential that you maintain a clear picture of your department's contribution to that model, which will primarily come in the form of headcount expenses (current and future). is model should provide some level of constraint, in the form of either an annualized budget or an expense run-rate, that will guide the timing of your hires.

### Hiring Goals and Objectives

Just as with designing software systems, when you sit down to design your interview process, you should begin by considering your requirements and goals. While every company should and will have its own requirements and perspective, here are some of the things I consider when designing an interview process:

**Efficiency:** How much time and cost does it take to hire a candidate?

**Success rate:** How successful on the job are hired candidates and how long do they stay with the firm?

**Candidate experience:** Do candidates come away thinking highly of your company after going through the process, regardless of whether they were hired?

**Equitable opportunities:** Have you ensured that every person has a fair shot at being hired, and avoided unconscious bias as much as possible?

**Scalability:** Can people other than you run the process and be as effective/have a success rate similar to yours?

#### EFFICIENCY

Hiring well is an expensive undertaking for your company. That cost comes in actual dollars, be it for recruiters, job board listings, or job advertisements. It also costs time, primarily in employee time spent conducting interviews. As you design your interview process, consider what your intention is with each step, what you are filtering for, and what is the most efficient way to accomplish that filtering.

One way to reduce or at least spread out the time investment is to include other team members in the hiring process. Depending on the subject matter of a given interview, you don't always need your most senior engineers in the room. A hiring coordinator, with appropriate training, can do a phone screen, a culture interview, or a reference check just as effectively as a senior engineer or executive.

#### SUCCESS RATE

Not every hire is going to be a home run for your company. Some will be leveled incorrectly, some won't be a culture fit, and others will be fired or quit in the first year. Especially as you scale an interview process, you need to measure how many hires are successful. This is one of the few opportunities as a technical leader where you can calculate clear, consistent, and indicative metrics, so take advantage and ensure your process is top notch. Consider tracking time to hire (from posting a job description until a new hire start date), overall employee retention, new hire attrition (or down-leveling), as well as how many new hires are promoted in their first two years.

As Andy Grove discusses in *High Output Management*, even a world- class interview process is successful only about 70 percent of the time. Fundamentally, there are many risks in hiring: you're trying to predict how someone will perform forty hours a week, week in and week out, based on just a few conversations and data points gathered in an interview process.

The best leaders track their success rate, are not afraid of admitting hiring mistakes, and will hire slow, fire fast.

There's no getting around it: firing a new employee who isn't working out shortly after they were hired is socially awkward and uncomfortable for everyone. It is, however, the responsible thing to do for your team. Some practices to help provide transparency to new employees and assist managers in making good decisions include implementing a formal ninety-day probationary or introductory period and required new-employee/ manager check-ins every fifteen or thirty days, or using a contract-to-hire employment structure.

#### CANDIDATE EXPERIENCE

Candidate experience is how candidates feel about your company during and after they go through your hiring process. Many candidates will do due diligence on your company before applying or interviewing. They re likely to look at online forums and social media and see what other candidates or employees who went through your process have to say about you.

You can't always control what people say about you, but nonetheless, you want to provide the sort of candidate experience that makes them more likely to read good things online, have a great experience themselves, and thus be more inclined to continue with your interviews and accept your offers.

#### EQUITABLE OPPORTUNITIES

There's a saying that people tend to hire people who look like themselves. This is often the result of unsophisticated interview scoring methods that simply rely on an interviewer's gut feeling, and gut feelings are often strongly influenced by unconscious bias. is bias can disadvantage candidates of other races, genders, ethnicities, etc.

As you design your interview process, you should focus on evaluations based on a rubric that aligns with requirements from a job description, not just an interviewer's gut feeling. See the Avoiding Bias section in Interviewing Best Practices, page 63, for more about avoiding biases.

#### SCALABILITY

It's all well and good if you, individually, are capable of hiring effectively. At some point, there will be more open roles than you can hire yourself, and you'll need to scale the process and bring in other people. To do so effectively, you must build a repeatable system that others can leverage to identify top talent and hire with the same efficacy and success rate as you.

That means that somebody else will need to be able to conduct the same interviews and draw the same conclusions at the end of that process that you likely would have if you'd conducted the interviews yourself.

The goal of the remainder of this section is to help you create a scalable system for interviewing and hiring that fits your organization's goals and can work seamlessly *without* your direct involvement (once you've taken the time to calibrate it). By defining and deploying this kind of structure, creating thoughtful documentation, and templating, you enable others to conduct interviews and produce candidate ranking scores that would closely mirror your own.

### The Job Description

Many companies underestimate the value of a great job description. A really good job description does two main things for you: it helps you create clarity and alignment internally with your company on what the role does and the value it can offer, and it advertises your company and attracts the kind of applicants that could be a good fit.

#### Surveying the Market

Before starting to write a job description I encourage you to do a survey of the market. Look at competing or similar companies and the job descriptions they have for similar roles.

Often these posts can provide good inspiration and calibration, especially when you're hiring for less common roles that may not be as well addressed by the scalable system you've put in place.

#### Creating Clarity on a Role

The traditional job description has a brief description of what the role will do, followed by a bulleted list of requirements for the candidate. I encourage you to write more than that. Rather than focusing on what a successful candidate will do in a particular role, think through the purpose the role serves. What outcomes does the role drive? What kind of impact do you expect from this role in three, six, or twelve months? You may or may not want to publish the answer to these questions as part of the job description, but the exercise of going into detail on expectations will prove valuable nonetheless.

Socialize the answers to these questions with other leaders at your organization and ensure they agree with the answers. Don't be surprised if you get significant feedback on the first version of the responsibilities and outcomes of a role. At most startups, before a headcount is formally opened, there is a high-level, unstructured conversation around a specific title. Oh, we need to hire a senior JavaScript backend engineer. Theact of writing and socializing the job description enables your team to get precise about what the company really needs, so it's natural that you'll need to do a few revisions.

#### Job Descriptions as an Advertisement

Everything your company posts publicly is a reflection of your culture and brand. A job description is no exception. The job description targets the single most valuable customer of that culture and brand: your employees, present and future. Ideally, the right candidate someone who not only meets your job requirements but who is also a great culture fit reads your job description and is excited about both the role and the company itself.

Some ways to help your job description reflect your culture:

* Include your company's core values, mission, or vision whatever you have front and center.

* Include the impact that the role will have on your team, company, and customers.

* Advertise your team structure, working environment, and size.

* Highlight your compensation and benefits (posting a salary range is legally required in some markets).

In addition to elements aimed to pique candidate interest, it's a good idea to include some often-overlooked details to help candidates self-tier:

* Include leveling and compensation brackets.

* Include location, on-site requirements, and whether remote work is allowed and to what extent.

* Include time zone/working hour requirements.

### Sourcing Candidates

When it comes to filling roles in your organization, you'll source qualified candidates in three ways: inbound recruiting, outbound recruiting, and referrals. An effective, scalable hiring process should be designed to leverage all three methods.

#### INBOUND RECRUITING

Inbound recruiting is about marketing your job opening and collecting voluntary candidate applications. Much like any other marketing exercise, a one-channel approach may not be enough to drive results.

As such, posting a job description on a job board is the bare minimum. Depending on the state of the market, how many roles you're hiring for, and the quality/clarity of your job description, the posting alone may be sufficient. Often you'll need to do more to draw in top talent, including actively promoting your roles in specialized tech communities and/or marketing your brand via conference attendance/sponsorship, a company blog, social media outreach, etc.

There is no universal best venue for placing classified ads that great employees turn to. Keep your ear to the ground for whatever platform/job site seems to be most common and post your job description accordingly. This is something a good Applicant Tracking System (ATS) will help you with, as it can track a referral source for every candidate and provide metrics around which job boards bring in better/more candidates that make it deeper into your process than others. When hiring designers in particular, it's important to talk to some working designers about where the most popular portfolio hosting sites are and maintain a presence on those job boards to find the best candidates.

You'll also want to monitor how many applications you're receiving for each role. At a minimum, your hiring manager(s) should be looking at the state of the funnel for their roles on a weekly basis and adjusting their approach accordingly. If a role isn't getting enough applicants (or is attracting the wrong applicants), then change something! Try tweaking the job title or posting the job description to new channels. A key element of a strong hiring process is the same as any other process you build for your team: a humble willingness to revisit past decisions and improve over time.

#### OUTBOUND RECRUITING

Outbound recruiting involves proactively reaching out to target candidates and encouraging them to apply for your role. is can be done by you, your team, an internal recruiter, and/or an external recruiter. I encourage teams to start their hiring process with inbound recruiting and in-house outbound recruiting first. By actually doing the recruiting, talking to the candidates, and listening to their reactions to your pitch, you'll learn a lot about the market and what top candidates think of what you're selling. you'll also get a sense of how competitive your offer is and how easy or hard it is to find candidates that match your job description, perhaps even leading you to tweak it. Once you've fine-tuned the role and know exactly whom and what you're looking for, you'll be ready to give optimized guidance to an external recruiter, which will help them source candidates more effectively on your behalf.

Not all external recruiters are the same. You want somebody who meets all of these criteria:

* Highly organized

* Able to effectively sell your role (it's your job to train and hold them accountable to do this well)

* Motivated to follow up relentlessly without being pushy or obnoxious

* Inclined to value the relationship with both you and the candidate more than the commission for a single placement

#### REFERRALS

The highest return on investment in hiring comes from internal referrals, i.e., referrals from your existing employees. People are much more likely to want to do business with a company that is spoken highly of by a current team member, and it's often easier to find a cultural fit when the candidate has already been vetted by someone familiar with your culture. You can encourage internal referrals by providing cash incentives (see sidebar) or having good communication with referees as to the status of their referrals.

Given that referrals have such a high chance of success, you want to provide the best possible candidate experience. You may also want to consider an abbreviated (but fair) hiring process. Skipping or compressing any top- of-funnel coarse filters, such as phone screeners or qualification forms, may be appropriate. You may also want to encourage the referrer to contribute a paragraph or two, in writing, justifying their referral.

### A Note on the Mathematics of Incentivizing Referrals

Based on the data you likely already have, it's relatively easy to approximate the cost (in both time and actual dollars spent) to hire a new engineer for your company. If you consider that referrals often have a substantially higher conversion rate to hire, it becomes clear that referrals save thousands to tens of thousands of dollars, which can help you justify a multi-thousand-dollar bonus to any employee who refers a candidate who is ultimately hired and stays in their role for more than a few months.

### Interviewing Best Practices

The interview flow is where the rubber meets the road on your ability to determine how well a candidate fits the role you're hiring for. Keep in mind that there is no perfect interview. The amount of data an interviewer collects in a sparse few hours with a candidate, of course, cannot perfectly predict how well somebody will do full-time on the job for months and years to come.

In this section, I cover some high-level interviewing best practices, and then provide some background and context on the various steps of interviewing, including candidate/résumé intake forms, phone screens, culture interviews, technical interviews, coding assignments, or take-home assignments, executive interviews, and finally reference checks.

#### REJECTED CANDIDATES OPINIONS MATTER

When designing your interview process, your candidate experience should be top of mind and a top priority. Even if you choose not to hire a candidate, that person will walk away with an impression good or bad of you and your company. That impression may lead to them singing your praises to those in their professional network who may someday apply for your roles. Or that impression could lead them to rant negatively about you every chance they get.

Job boards and Google reviews are littered with the evidence of interviews running amok, and it's very difficult to undo the damage to your reputation once it's been done. While it's true that, for some candidates, no amount of respect and consideration on your part will prevent the bitter sting of rejection from poisoning their takeaway opinion of you, those people are in the minority. For most candidates who get to the interview stage, a respectful and thoughtful interviewing process will leave them with a neutral-to-positive feeling about your company and help you avoid negative press online.

#### BE TIMELY AND MAKE SCHEDULING EASY

Ideally, you/your team will communicate the steps and scope of your hiring process to candidates upfront and leverage an easy, reliable solution for scheduling those steps in real time. For example, you can choose to (A) designate a hiring manager to handle all of the scheduling during business hours, (B) schedule all of the interviews in advance, or (C) provide an online tool that candidates can use to schedule their interviews asynchronously on their own time.

Truly, anything is better than requiring each interviewer to email each candidate before each interview to set up schedules sequentially, which can drag out an interview process over weeks or months.

#### ASK ONLY NEW QUESTIONS

Every interview touchpoint should feel to the candidate like a continuation of the conversation, rather than a rehashing of details that were discussed in prior sessions. Avoiding the latter requires thoughtful structuring and careful planning in advance of your interviews.

Ideally, subsequent interviews should be used to dive deeper and explore areas specific to a candidate or role, where both parties are looking to fully understand key strengths and weaknesses. Sharing suggested areas to focus on or new questions to ask with subsequent interviewers via an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) is a great way to ensure continuity, efficiency, and a great candidate experience that can reveal whether or not your potential hires are a true fit for your team.

#### AVOID BIASES

If you're unfamiliar with the phrase unconscious bias, I encourage you to read *inking Fast and Slow* by Daniel Kahneman. It's my go-to book for understanding many types of systematic errors our brains make.

It's actually very easy to unintentionally advantage or disadvantage a candidate in ways that are not justified. Inevitably, this will result in worse hiring outcomes or potentially costly legal battles.

Bias takes many forms. Most biases are unconscious and can surround gender, race, alumni status, or socioeconomic background. But bias can also mean that the conclusions drawn by an interviewer about a candidate ahead of an interview are based solely on ranking scores from a prior interviewer. There's no system that ensures eliminating all harmful biases, but there are certain steps you can take to minimize unconscious bias, such as blanking out candidate names or photos (which often hint at gender and ethnicity) during a résumé screen.

To avoid anchoring or biasing subsequent interviewers, I encourage interviewers to leave two different kinds of feedback on candidate conversations:

1. Detailed notes and scores
2. Suggested questions for subsequent conversations.

Most of the interview feedback should consist of detailed notes and scores against the job-specific scoring guide which has your interview questions planned out in advance (for more, see Technical Interviews, page 76). is feedback should ideally not be read by subsequent team members in advance of their interview to avoid bias. For example, if you know the prior interviewer scored the candidate poorly, you may experience confirmation bias and overvalue any areas where a candidate does poorly in your interview.

The second type of feedback, subsequent interview suggestions, should focus on areas for emphasis or more in-depth exploration in subsequent interviews and not reveal data that might overtly bias further interviews.

#### USAGE OF AN APPLICANT TRACKING SYSTEM (ATS)

When interviewing more than two or three candidates simultaneously, it can require a substantial effort to manage the logistics of where candidates stand in the process, coordinate notes from interviewers, and communicate consistently and promptly with candidates as they move through the funnel. Without a finely tuned system to manage all of these logistics, it's easy for candidate experience to suffer and for hiring costs to rise. This is a universal problem, and several high-quality, off-the- shelf Applicant Tracking System (ATS) solutions have been developed at various price points and levels of sophistication to address this problem.

The guidance here is simple: choose and onboard an ATS early. Don't wait until your process is already underwater to take action. Train your team, require widespread adoption of the system, and set expectations for its use with HR, hiring managers, and interviewers.

#### SELLING CANDIDATES

As mentioned earlier, I highly encourage hiring managers to think of the interview process as a sales process. is naturally leads to several good habits that translate seamlessly from sales to interviews:

* During the sales process with a customer, you're always focused on selling the prospect on the product, even when you're qualifying the customer. A good sales process regards qualifying candidates as a funnel, with light-touch qualification at the top and progressively more nuanced/time-intensive qualification down-funnel, along with a progressively more customized and tailored sales pitch.

* You should always be selling your candidates on the advantages and positive benefits of joining your company and the role/opportunity you're offering. By the time they jump through all your interviewing hoops, they should be eager to work at your company and excited to take your job offer over others they have received (or may yet receive).

* Ensure you're asking at least a couple of open-ended questions early on about what the candidate is looking for in their next role. is will help your interviewers synthesize how good a match the candidate's expectations are for the role you're hiring for. is information should be noted in the candidate's profile and used to tailor and customize the pitch to the candidate along the way.
  * For example, a junior candidate coming from a mostly junior and mid-level team may be looking for the opportunity to work with more senior JavaScript engineers in an environment that promotes their growth. If your team offers senior support and your culture leans into mentorship, make sure you highlight that advantage, especially around the offer stage.

* Always leave candidates some time (five or ten minutes) to ask questions at the end of the interview. Most qualified candidates come to interviews armed with questions, and you can learn a lot about what somebody cares about by what they choose to ask. This is a good opportunity for your interviewer to sell the benefits of your company in their responses.

* Along the way, ensure candidates feel respected and are progressively exposed to more of your company. Your best candidates need to feel like they were intelligently vetted *and* like they ve learned enough about the company to get excited. Ideally, you want even rejected candidates to be able to leave positive reviews on Google and Glassdoor. You can accomplish that by selling your company's benefits throughout the interview, respecting people's time as if it were your own, having consistent and timely communication, and ensuring that everyone feels the process was as fair and transparent as possible.

### Intake Forms

The beginning of the interview funnel is a form that achieves two goals: it provides the candidate with some information about your company and its hiring process, and thus a sample of its culture; and it takes in a bunch of information from the candidate to act as an inexpensive, coarse- grained filter.

Intake Form Preamble

At the top of your intake form, you should outline several key pieces of information for candidates:

* Reiterate the role they are applying for and its key requirements and impact.

* Reiterate your company's core values and provide a sample of your culture.

* Set expectations for the hiring process, how long it will take, how many steps there are, and generally what the process looks like.

#### Intake Form Questionnaire

The questionnaire should include a request for the candidate's résumé (or LinkedIn profile URL), ask some questions required by legal and HR with respect to employment eligibility, and then ideally ask a few qualifying questions of the candidate. The qualifying questions should be light-touch, generally freeform, and possibly even technical questions to ensure the candidate is in the right ballpark for the role. For example, for a role that requires experience in JavaScript, it's not unreasonable to confirm that experience in the questionnaire with a question like, Rate your comfort level working with JavaScript on a scale from not comfortable to extremely comfortable.

This may seem redundant to the requirements listed in the job description, and it is, though you'd be surprised how many résumés will come through lacking basic qualifications. These questions are quick/trivial for the candidate to answer and just as quick for a hiring manager to use to filter out applicants.

If you're inundated with candidates and want to do a bit more filtering at this stage, the questionnaire can also include one or two more interesting or difficult questions. If you include these, be sure to still keep them brief; you don't want to lose candidates in this form because the questions were too arduous. If you're overwhelmed with applicants then bias towards more data to filter with here, otherwise maybe it's best to save more nuanced qualifications for further down the funnel.

Some example questions for an intake form covering broad compatibility and self-identified technical familiarity (I've included a sample at ctohb. com/templates):

* As a great candidate, you'll receive a ton of offers. Compensation and benefits being equal, what will make you pick one company over another?

* What are deal makers and deal breakers in your next move?

* What gives you energy in your work? What taxes your energy?

* What are your geographic expectations (location, remote, on-site)?

* How familiar are you with basic technical qualifiers: rank familiarity with [relevant programming language or tool] on a scale of 1-10?

#### Phone Screen

The initial phone screen, like everything in the interview process, serves a dual function: it's an opportunity to learn more about the candidate, and it's the candidate's first interaction with (and evaluation of) a human at your company.

Given that this is the first person the candidate will have an interaction with at your company, it's worth thinking carefully about who conducts the interview. The questions at this point should not be very technical in nature and so it's not necessary that the interview be conducted by a member of the technical team. Often it is done by HR or a dedicated recruiting team.

Regardless of who runs the phone screen, ensure that person is a good cultural representative for your team/company and is equipped with the information technical candidates are likely to ask for at this stage, including:

What the software stack looks like, including key languages, tools, and target clients (e.g., mobile, desktop, etc.). The interviewer should have a rudimentary understanding of the words they are using here, and not just reading off a list.

The size of the technical team, both at large in the company and that

the candidate would be working with. is should also include general hiring forecasts and roughly how many people are being added over time.

Who the candidate would be reporting to. Provide some basic background on that manager, including their tenure at the company, maybe what they did before working at the company.

A great sense of the company's core values/culture and way of doing work.

The interviewer's goal should be to introduce the candidate to the company, its culture, the role, and the hiring process. They will also ask some high-level questions of the candidate to confirm their structural fit for the role. You want a candidate to walk away from this interview motivated to do well in the rest of the interview process and excited at the idea of working for your company.

The exact questions asked in a phone screen are thus not super important. Here is an outline of some areas you may want to cover:

* Do they have anything constraining their hiring timeline (e.g., other job offers)?
* Where is the candidate located, and are they willing to relocate if necessary?
* Roughly when can they start or are they looking to start?
* Confirm compensation expectations are aligned and explain benefits/perks.

In addition to good answers to the questions, the interviewer should gauge their general fit for the role. Does the candidate communicate clearly, do they seem like a culture fit, does their claimed experience match what they have on their résumé, and are they interested in the company and opportunity?

### Culture Interview

One of the major criteria you're looking for in your interview process is culture fit. Culture fit is all the elements of a candidate's personality, beyond their experience and skills, that will enable them to be successful

in your organization. In order to effectively screen candidates for culture fit, your company should have a fairly clear idea of what its culture is. is can look like many things for example, a list of core values, a mission statement, a vision statement, guiding principles. Whatever they are, they should be authentic and true to the company. If you're struggling on this,

I would refer you to *Team of Teams* by Stanley McChrystal, *Work Rules!* by Laszlo Bock, and *Good Authority* by Jonathan Raymond.

Currently, there are few formally structured interview programs that are widely used. The one that does come up fairly regularly is called *topgrading* which refers to at least two different things: the topgrading method and the topgrading interview. The topgrading method (ctohb. com/topgrading) is an entire book hiring methodology that was purportedly developed by General Electric in the 1980s/90s and written about in Verne Harnish's *Scaling Up*. The topgrading interview (ctohb.com/interview), which I call the culture interview, is a specific interview agenda, style, and structure designed to learn about a candidate's background and cultural fit.

As formally designed, the topgrading interview walks a candidate through their employment history and asks the same set of questions about each of the candidate's prior few roles. Depending on the candidate's history and how long they spent at their past few roles, you should cover anywhere from two to five past positions. You want to capture a long enough period of time to try and identify trends and see growth, but also not keep the candidate in the interview for three hours discussing internships they had in college twenty years ago.

For each role, topgrading has the interviewer ask the following questions:

* What were some notable successes or accomplishments in this position?

* What were some mistakes or failures in this position? What was your supervisor's name and title?

* What do you think the supervisor's honest assessment of your strengths and weaknesses would be?

* What do you feel your supervisor's strengths and weaknesses were?

In addition to this interview formula, topgrading suggests a two-interviewer approach: the lead, who is actively engaging in conversation and getting curious with the candidate; and a dedicated notetaker.

Whether you're using one or two interviewers, taking notes is critically important. To review candidates fairly, you will want to create a scorecard in advance of interviewing your first candidate which evaluates a candidate's answers, looking for alignment to your company culture. For example, if respectful challenge is a company core value, ask the candidate if they could identify any instances of challenging respectfully. Or did they speak disrespectfully about any past coworkers? Using notes after the interview to complete and justify scores on a scorecard is essential.

### Coding Challenge

Requiring take-home assignments also referred to as coding challenges or interviewing homework is a controversial topic. Take-homes are often a significant investment of time for candidates and are thus a significant source of candidate drop-off in the hiring funnel. It's not hard to imagine in-demand candidates being asked to do several take-homes, each of them requiring many hours or days of work, adding up to weeks of work. When facing those requests, it's understandable that candidates will prioritize the assignments for companies they are most excited about and/or have the most tractable assignments.

Despite these structural challenges, from a hiring manager's perspective, it's critical to have one. How can you hire a software engineer without having had them write code for you?

To summarize, there are three competing factors:

**Establish Predictive Ability:** Employers desire to have candidates actually produce code in a software engineering interview process to try and predict on-the-job performance.

**Minimize Drop Off:** Employers desire to have candidates actually complete coding assignments and not fall out in the funnel.

**Improve Candidate Experience:** Candidates desire to feel like their time is respected and the assigned tasks are reasonable. Ideally, a candidate should learn more about your company through this assignment and be even more excited about your opportunity.

#### Predictive Ability

There are several styles of coding interview or assignment. Assignments range from take-home projects with a prompt, to using an online platform for programming exercises (also sometimes known as code katas ), to live pair programming. Absent any empirical data about the predictive capability of these styles, I encourage you to design an exercise that looks as much like regular day-to-day work at your company as possible. If you don't do any pair programming at your company, then gauging how a candidate performs in an interview setting pair programming, intuitively, doesn't feel highly correlated/predictive. At the very least it's collecting tangential signals.

As a manager, your aim is to get the best out of the people you work with. With that in mind, try and recall the last time you were interviewed and exercise your empathy muscle when designing your coding assignment. Being interviewed is, for most, a very stressful process, and being asked to be creative or problem-solve in that scenario doesn't always bring out the best performance. Some ways to help candidates do their best work on a coding assignment are:

* Provide flexibility in choice of language/tools where possible.

* Allow for work to be done asynchronously (i.e., take-home instead of live coding).
  * If you're indexing strongly on signals from the coding process such that take-homes are not rich enough, consider asking the candidate to record themselves (via Loom or other similar tools) doing a part of the exercise.

* Be explicit about what you're looking for in the candidate's output. For example, if your scoring rubric measures how well they ve documented their code, then ensure the prompt the candidate is given tells them to include documentation. Or if you plan to run the code, let the candidate know whether you'll just be evaluating correctness, or if other elements matter, such as performance, negative cases, etc.

#### Candidate Experience and Drop-Off

Candidates are more likely to complete your take-home coding assignment if they find it interesting and easy to get started. The best assignments are topically related to your business and ideally expose the candidate to the kind of problems your company actually faces on a daily basis.

**Bad example:** You're a web SaaS platform, and you assign a candidate to do a challenge related to mobile phone development.

**Good example:** Your company integrates with many legacy third-party APIs, and your challenge is to build a limited integration with a Sandbox API with similar domain nouns/verbs to the real business.

Providing candidates with existing code repositories that have working build systems/tests to start with can save the candidate time bootstrapping a build themselves.

To be respectful of a candidate's time, I suggest providing a hard time limit for the take-home. The goal of a time limit is not to provide time pressure and force fast-paced delivery, but to ensure candidates are not overinvesting in the challenge and feel that the challenge is a reasonable request. To ensure candidates understand the time limit, you should:
* Provide ample explanation of the time limit
* Ensure that the task is readily achievable in the time limit specified
* Let candidates know how their submission will be evaluated. If your scoring rubric rates the candidate's README file, then let the candidate know they should spend time writing a README. If the code will be run either live with the candidate or by an interviewer asynchronously let them know that runtime will be judged. If you mostly care about architectural decisions and you're less concerned about runtime performance, let them know that, too, so they can spend time in the right way.


### Technical Interviews

As controversial and varied as the methodologies for take-home coding interviews are, technical interviews themselves are even more varied. In general, I encourage you to follow the same fundamentals: ensure you're collecting signals relevant to the actual job, and be respectful and considerate of candidates themselves.

The classic technical interview, practiced by many of the largest tech companies, involves some form of shared whiteboard experience where the candidate is asked to solve a technical problem in real time. The problems range from the academic, sort an array with some special conditions, to high-level/hand-wavy architecture, design a system to handle 100 million users posting news feed updates.

The classic interview approach must work for the big companies, as they continue to use it year after year, but I don't see how they work at a startup. They re often overly broad, or overly narrow, and thus difficult to score fairly. The academic questions are rarely correlated with the types of problems one solves on a daily basis on the job.

Most damning, they're not setting candidates up to be successful in the interview environment. After all, I'm sure there are very few engineers at the big companies writing array-sorting algorithms as part of their day job.

The methodology I outline in this chapter represents an alternative approach I've seen and used myself successfully in a startup environment.

#### METHODOLOGY

What follows is a methodology I've used, derived from lessons in topgrading, to filter and hire senior software engineering candidates. In the spirit of topgrading, I call it the technical focus interview.

#### Technical Focus Interview Guide

To find out where a candidate's strengths and weaknesses are, and how much that matters in the role you are hiring for, first you need to decide what topic areas matter for your role. You do this by creating a technical focus interview guide, which should include a list of anywhere from four to eight technical areas, and within each area a set of sample questions, best practice answers, and a scoring guide.

The sample answers and scoring guide are included to ensure fairness and uniformity in scoring across multiple interviewers and across candidates. You're trying to differentiate where any given candidate has gaps vs. true expertise, so your questions should be designed to elicit one of three kinds of answers: bad, good, and amazing. Thus, they should lend themselves to being scored as such. When it comes to scoring a question, to make the difference between a knowledge gap and true expertise obvious, I recommend that a bad answer gets a score of 0‒2, a good answer gets a score of 3‒6, and only an amazing answer gets between 7‒10.

When I say a bad answer, I mean a response to the question that demonstrates either little to no experience or expertise with the topic at hand. A good answer demonstrates competency, maybe even a very high level of competency, in the topic. An amazing answer demonstrates not only competency but true understanding and intellectual depth on the topic. For example, if the question concerns how the candidate thinks about designing a unit test suite, and their answer is they ve never thought about it, that's a 0 and you've found a gap. If their answer includes a description of some test suites they ve designed and some justification for it, that's good, perhaps a 5 or 6. If their answer includes a full outline of test suite design philosophies and the pros and cons of each and how to apply them in different scenarios, now you're looking at real expertise and a 7‒10 score.

In the spirit of giving candidates the best chance at success, I don't recommend scoring every question. Instead, provide a score on a topic area. This way you can try multiple questions within a topic, looking for areas of expertise with a candidate and scoring the net result for that topic.

Make no mistake, writing these questions, sample answers, and scoring guides is a lot of work. The good news is that any given question is useful across multiple roles and can be reused over a long period of time. In fact, I encourage you to maintain a central repository of questions (and associated sample answers/scoring guides). When it comes time to write the next technical focus interview guide, you'll find your job much easier by being able to reuse questions from the repository as appropriate.

See https://ctohb.com/templates for an example focus guide from my own question repository.

#### Hiring Juniors vs. Seniors

The qualities you're looking for in a junior hire, with say one to two years of coding experience, should be very different from a senior hire with ten-plus years. The ideal junior hire should be curious, eager to learn, and have solid programming fundamentals to work in incremental feature development. A senior hire, by contrast, should come with not just programming fundamentals but deep thinking on architecture, opinions, and best practices across a wide range of tools and problems, and be able to develop trust that they can not only build incremental features but own and make good decisions in architecture for new greenfield projects. Since the key value these two types of roles offer is so different, it should follow that your interviews for them should be different.

For a senior hire, the focus interview where you deeply explore the candidate's decision-making skills, understanding of concepts, and architectural know-how is critical and should be weighed heavily. For a junior role, that knowledge deep-dive should be shorter, and weighed less heavily than a practical coding exercise.

#### The Interview Itself

The senior software engineer technical focus interview is typically a sixty to ninety-minute conversation between the candidate and a lead interviewer, ideally with a primarily silent second interviewer on hand to take notes. Depending on the length of your focus guide and how many subjects you want to cover, you may consider splitting out the subjects into multiple focus interviews.

I emphasize that this interview should be conversational; you're looking to find out which areas of software engineering the candidate is most knowledgeable and passionate about, and in which areas they ve either never been held accountable or have historically delegated. Doing this does not require brainteasers, pair programming, or any problem-solving. Simply ask!

Start the interview informally with some light conversation. After a minute or two, begin describing the agenda/plan for the meeting. Let the candidate know you have a document with an interview guide in it, and your goal is to get the candidate to discuss the topics in that guide over the next sixty to seventy-five minutes, leaving fifteen minutes at the end for them to ask you questions.

After the preamble you'll jump into the first section of the interview guide. Your goal in every section of the guide is not to ask every single question. You're looking first to determine which of the three categories the candidate falls into for that subject area bad, good, or amazing and then

to narrow down a score from there. You should have a pretty good idea of where to categorize the candidate after the first question or two, then use follow-up questions to probe further to narrow in on a score.

If a candidate completely misses, or admits they are not familiar with a topic, there is no need to keep going to every question; you've got your score and you can move on.

On the other hand, if a candidate nails the first question, they may well be a true expert in that area, but you likely won't be confident of their mastery until they ve provided insightful answers to multiple questions across the subject. Typically, it takes more time and questioning to identify mastery than a lack of qualification.

Don't hesitate to politely cut off a candidate's answer and move on to the next category when you know you've heard enough. Your goal is to help the candidate demonstrate their skill and knowledge across all the topics that you've decided are important for this role and chosen to evaluate in this interview. Letting a candidate rabbit-hole and consume time on a single topic when you already have all the information you need for a score robs them of the opportunity to demonstrate their capabilities in other topics if you run out of time in the interview. It is your job, not the candidate s, to manage the pace of the interview.

### Executive interviews

By the time a candidate gets to an executive round interview, you should have already confirmed that they have the skills required in your job description and will be a suitable culture fit for your company. The executive interview, in most scenarios, is less about an executive screening a candidate and more a chance for the candidate to meet and ask questions of the executive.

If, however, the candidate is applying for a very senior role, or is going to be reporting directly to the executive, then it may be appropriate for this last interview to be longer or more thorough than simply candidate Q&A.

### Reference Checks

With reference checks, you need to strike a balance between scheduling them early enough in the interview process to ensure that they don't create a bottleneck and not wasting time on reference checks for candidates who will not get offers. Keep in mind that candidates, rightfully, may be hesitant to provide references until they're at the end of a process to protect their own relationships with the references.

#### TIMING

It follows then that reference checks almost always happen last in an interview process. To avoid having to delay an offer on completing reference checks, here are a few tips:

* Begin scheduling meetings, in parallel, with all references as soon as they are provided. Given their brief nature, the most efficient strategy may be able to call references without scheduling.

* Consider making an offer before completing references, but be clear with candidates that offer finalization is contingent on references coming back and meeting expectations. Reference checks, assuming you've done a good job with your filtering process up until this point, have a high success rate, so rarely will contingent offers have to be withdrawn due to failed reference interviews.

* Be flexible on who conducts reference interviews, as it does not have to be a member of technical staff. It does need to be somebody who is highly responsive to email and has considerable availability in their calendar to accommodate references.

#### CONTENT

In general, reference interviews should be brief and respectful of the reference's time and willingness to help. Most reference interviews provide feedback ranging from neutral to enthusiastically positive. Very seldom will you receive overtly negative feedback, so your goal is to quickly differentiate between neutral and enthusiastically positive, confirm any strengths/weaknesses identified in the interview process, and move on. If you do get any overtly negative feedback in a reference interview, pay very close attention and try to get specific details on the criticism to bring back to the hiring manager.

Some sample questions for a reference interview:

* In what context did you work with [name of candidate]?

* Qualify how credible the reference is: have you managed many other engineers in your career?

* What were [name of candidate]'s biggest strengths?

* What were [name of candidate]'s biggest areas for improvement back then?

* How would you rate their job performance in that job on a 1 10 scale?
* What about their performance causes you to give that rating?
* [Name of candidate] mentioned that they struggled with \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ in that
job. Can you tell me more about that?

* In what environment and under what management style would [name

of candidate] be most successful?

* How does [name of candidate] manage conflict?

* Would you rehire [name of candidate] given the chance?

#### Making an Offer

By the time you're ready to make somebody an offer you should have a strong opinion, based on the job description and feedback from your focus interviews, on the level at which you would be bringing in the candidate. From there it should be relatively straightforward to identify a salary/ bonus/equity amount using your predefined leveling bands. (See 1.4.2 Compensation and Leveling, for more on this.)

Once you've calibrated your offer amounts, you should decide how to present the offer. Especially if your offer includes equity compensation, you should seriously consider providing a spreadsheet that provides context to the offer amounts. The value of a number of shares on its own is impossible for a candidate to assess. They need additional data points to value what you're offering, including numbers like total shares outstanding, share strike price, latest company valuation, etc.

I've prepared a sample candidate offer spreadsheet at ctohb.com/ samples.

#### PRESENTING THE OFFER

The moment when you present the offer is when you need to be in super sales mode. Ideally, you've been selling candidates all along the way so they're already very excited about the company and the opportunity for them. Regardless, this is a big deal for the candidate, so make sure to give the occasion the respect it deserves. roughout the process of explaining the offer, remember to be especially upbeat, congratulate the candidate, and emphasize the fun you'll have and the great things you'll build together. It's also critical that you're transparent and outline all the key points of the offer upfront, especially anything they may not be expecting or used to, such as equity compensation or probation/trial periods.

I recommend making the offer in three parts: a phone call, an email, and a dinner. For the phone call, I suggest calling the candidate without prior scheduling. At this point you'll have already done a whole bunch of scheduling with the candidate, so There'sno need to build up their anxiety further by scheduling yet another meeting. Alternatively, you could tell them in writing that you intend to extend an offer and schedule from there, but you lose the impact of being on the line with them when they get the news. I find it's just simpler to call the person and share the news all at once.

On the call, you should express excitement, convey the key points of the offer, and answer any initial questions. Explain that subsequent to the call you'll email them written materials to help provide context on the equity and, of course, a formal written offer letter will be coming from the company. And finally, if logistically possible, schedule a meal with the candidate to have a more personal, in-depth conversation.
