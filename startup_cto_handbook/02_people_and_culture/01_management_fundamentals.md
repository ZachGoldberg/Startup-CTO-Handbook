## Management Fundamentals

Recommended Reading: *Managing Humans* by Michael Lopp

The golden rule of management: do what it takes to get the best out of your team. In technical leadership as in any other leadership role, the best measure of your performance as a manager is the performance of the team itself. That means you should be thinking about and spending time doing everything necessary to help individual team members do their best work, both independently and collectively.

Helping your team succeed requires humility, as it entails consistently putting the needs of your direct reports above your own. You will need to adjust and tweak your style, behavior, thinking, and actions to suit the needs of members of your engineering team. That will include being willing to be wrong, being open-minded, and learning from your direct reports.

If you buy into this journey, know that you will make mistakes. Own those mistakes with your team and they will trust you more for it. Also know that being a perfect manager is not an achievable goal; the best you can hope for is to always be improving in small ways. After a career spent managing people, you'll have learned a lifetime of lessons about technology and human beings that will make you a more competent manager.

In *Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager*, Michael Lopp writes:

 *Every single person with whom you work has a vastly different set of needs. Fulfilling these needs is one way to make them content and productive. It is your full-time job to listen to these people and mentally document how they are built. This is your most important job. I know the senior VP of engineering is telling you that hitting the date for the project is job number one, but you are not going to write the code, test the product, or document the features. The team is going to do these things, and your job is to manage the team.*

In that one succinct paragraph, Lopp hits on all the key points of management. First and foremost, you are a listener, a personal and career development coach, and a shield against external forces in the world which might distract, stress, or otherwise prevent your team from doing their best work.


### The Professional Skill Tree

Many video games involve a concept of a skill tree. For those unfamiliar, a skill tree is a sequence of skills or abilities that are unlocked as the player progresses through the game. Each skill is unlocked by spending skill points. Here's the rub: at any given time, there are more skills to unlock than you have skill points to spend. The skill tree forces you to choose some skills before others. The skill tree provides a reasonable model for your career as well. At any given job, you're likely accumulating skill points toward some skills and not others.

In your journey to tech leadership, you've already invested many skill points into the technical/engineering branch of the skill tree. My key insight for you is that the management branch of the skill tree is equally vast, and if you've not been investing points in that area up to now, even if you're a Level 100 engineer you'll start your new leadership position as a Level 1 manager staring at a mighty oak tree of yet-to-be-unlocked crucial skills. Once your company has more than a small handful of engineers, these skills will make the difference in your ability to scale up with the team.

### Kaizen: Continuous Improvement

*Kaizen* is the Japanese word for improvement. The phrase was popularized as part of the Toyota Production System. At Toyota, all personnel are given a (literal or metaphorical) red handle to pull that stops the entire production line. If a worker identifies a problem with production, the idea is for them to pull the red handle, gather coworkers and resources to diagnose the issue, and then resolve it before work can continue. By empowering everyone on the team to improve the process and to be invested in its efficacy, Toyota can cost-effectively build higher-quality cars.

I'm not the first to suggest that software engineering has much in common with traditional manufacturing (see *The Phoenix Project* by Gene Kim). In this case, make the metaphor real: provide your team with a digital red handle and encourage them to focus on continuously improving everything you do. Members of great teams understand that, over time, the team will change, customer requirements will change, tools will change, and the team will need to revisit past decisions and make improvements.

*Kaizen* applies not only to your team's process but also to individuals. Your best team members will embrace the idea of continuous education and continuous improvement, and treat mistakes not as failures but as opportunities for improvement.

### Coaching

Your principal role as a manager is to get the best out of the people on your team, so in many scenarios it's more appropriate to describe your role as that of a coach rather than a manager. A coach is somebody who is on your side, a source of wisdom and guidance to everyone on their team. A coach is quick to provide critical feedback, but also the first to celebrate and praise success.

Your goal in your interactions with your direct reports, whether they are individual contributing engineers or managers themselves, is to be the best coach they've ever had.

### Find a Management Mentor

One way to jumpstart your leadership transition, coaching and managing others, is to find yourself a management mentor, rather than learning by trial and error. There are a lot of management coaches out there with different approaches; the challenge is to find one that resonates with you.

In my first role as a business leader at WiFast (then Zenreach, now Adentro) we quickly hired a team of ten full-time employees, mostly in engineering. As a first-time manager I knew I had a lot to learn, and I was eager to take advantage of every resource I could to become a better manager. My only problem was I hated most management advice. I found it either overly prescriptive (do X, then Y, then Z) without context or insight, or entirely devoid of substance fluff, if you will. That was until I met my first management coach, Jonathan.

The story goes that one of our investors, First Round Capital, was hosting a management summit in San Francisco, about a thirty-minute drive from our office. Thus far I'd found First Round folks were high quality, so when I came across the invitation, their support temporarily muted my ever-present fluff allergy and I signed up.

When I drove up to the summit, I was encouraged that the audience was relatively small, only about thirty people enough to fit into what felt like a high-school classroom. I sat down at the high-school folding-tray top desk, opened my notebook, took out a pen, and wrote the date and First Round Capital Management Summit at the top of the page. Sadly, that would be the only thing I wrote for the next four hours.

The first half of the day had three or four speakers talk about various topics, every one of them lacking in any actionable advice or insight. As we broke for lunch, I contemplated driving back early and getting in half a workday at the office. I checked the agenda and noticed an entirely different roster of afternoon speakers, so I decided I'd at least hear out the first one.

The first speaker after lunch was Jonathan. Unlike prior presenters, he had no slides and he seemed a little rushed, perhaps a tiny bit unprepared, or maybe just nervous, as he walked to the front of the class. The first words out of his mouth, however, told a different story:

*Allow me to transparently manipulate you.*

I'll never forget that moment. What a funny thing to say; it's a seeming contradiction in terms like saying, is sentence is false. (If you're curious, this is called the [Liar's paradox](https://ctohb.com/liarsparadox).) He went on to explain that that was exactly the point: he wanted to say something to grab our attention as an audience, and at that he succeeded perfectly. For the next thirty minutes I took copious notes, not on manipulating people but on understanding people in general.

I hung on every word Jonathan had to say. As the half-hour session wrapped, Jonathan said he had to catch a flight, and somewhat hurriedly ran out of the room. I looked down at my notebook, processed that I had taken three pages of notes in the last thirty minutes, then stood up from my chair and ran after him.

I managed to catch him just as he was getting into a yellow cab. Somewhat exasperated, Jonathan asked me what I wanted. I asked if he did private coaching. He replied, Ask the summit organizers to connect us. Cleverly, he didn't commit one way or another to coaching on the spot, leaving himself the opportunity to do due diligence on me via First Round before deciding if I was worth his time. Luckily for me, when I asked First Round to put us in touch, the contact said nice enough things about me that Jonathan agreed to an introductory coaching session.

### 1:1 MEETINGS

A 1:1 meeting is a private meeting between you and a direct report. It's tempting to treat 1:1s as status check-in meetings, and for the agenda to focus entirely on business or technical topics immediately at hand. It's all right if the agenda includes those topics, but this is your opportunity to establish a coaching relationship with your direct report. You should use this time to really get to know and understand how your report thinks, draw out and identify their strengths, and recognize weaknesses you can address to help the person do their best work.

### SKIP-LEVEL MEETINGS

It's good practice, on a semi-regular basis (monthly or quarterly), to have meetings with the direct reports of any managers that report to you. These are called skip-level meetings as you're skipping over a level on the organization chart by meeting with them directly. You're not trying to undermine your managers with skip-levels in fact, it's quite the opposite. By collecting more data and hearing different perspectives, you'll be better able to work with managers on things that can help improve the business.

Some quick thoughts for agendas of skip-level meetings:

* Put the employee at ease by making sure they know the purpose of the meeting that you're not there to problem-solve or make decisions that are better handled by their actual manager.

* Let them know that you want to build a relationship and hear their insights on leadership, culture, strategy, and company direction.

* Connect with the employee; ask questions and get curious.

* There are many good actual templates/agendas for skip-levels on the internet. Here's one from managementcenter.org that I recommend: ctohb.com/skip.

### COACHING MANAGERS

As your organization grows, you'll likely get to the point where you no longer have any individual contributor direct reports. Every direct contributor who actually writes code is managed by a middle manager. It should be obvious, then, that effective middle managers are critical to the performance of your organization. It's your job to make sure that your managers have the support, resources, training, and mentorship they need to enable them to do their best work coaching the engineers on their team.

The biggest contributor to cultivating high-quality middle management is, of course, hiring the right people, but second to that is ongoing training and support. If you're in a position to be overseeing a team of managers, I encourage you to build the following into your organization:

* Build a culture of continuous learning.

  * For example, encourage your managers to set up an internal management-focused book club.
  * Share insights you're learning yourself with the management team regularly, and have them do the same with their teams. If you're using a company chat tool, a dedicated channel for #management-insights or similar is a great place for this kind of dialog.

* Establish a high bar for coaching and management.

  - Be clear with your managers about your expectations for what management means, for expectations on coaching, 1:1s, performance management, etc.
  - Codify your management expectations unambiguously in internal documentation and make it part of management hiring and onboarding.

* Provide thorough and accessible management training materials.

   - Supply resources for your managers to pursue ongoing learning and professional development. is might include purchasing company subscriptions to learning programs, sponsoring employees to attend conferences, hiring management coaches, or formalizing internal or external mentorship programs.

  - Consider the cost for these training materials in your regular budgeting process for every member of your team.

* Develop an external-facing culture of thought leadership.

  - Encourage your managers to become thought leaders in your industry. is could take the form of a company, participating as a guest on technical or management podcasts, or speaking at conferences.

### 1:1 Meetings with Engineers

Your engineers should be venting at you regularly, so if they are, don't panic this is totally normal, and in fact highly desirable. You should have a 1:1 meeting with every member of your team at least once every two weeks, if not weekly. Your goal in these meetings is to create a safe space for your engineers to tell you what's on their mind, and for you to actively listen and engage on these topics.

With strong engineers, that will mean they're aware of imperfections in the world around them and they want to tell you about them. Your job is not to solve every problem they bring up; your job is to listen, to ask questions to clarify your understanding, and to convince them that you do understand, and then steer them toward solutions. From time to time, there may be a direct ask, or something you can directly help with, but that's not the norm.

The value you're providing here is making your direct reports feel heard and coaching them to productively handle issues themselves.

#### 1:1 Content and Agenda

Ultimately, your goal in a 1:1 meeting is to build a relationship with another person and have vulnerable and critical conversations that enable you to help them do their best work. If your direct report has a broad agenda, that's great, start there. However, if their agenda is consistently limited to tactical in-progress work items and you're not getting to those higher-level how- we-work conversations, then I encourage you to supplement their agenda so they better understand the purpose of your meetings and bring more substantive concerns to future sessions.

The easiest way to bridge your agenda and theirs is to have a shared document, perhaps with some structure/template, to elicit the kinds of discussion topics you think are important. Having this document available prior to your meeting also gives you and your employee a shared place to capture ideas in between meetings, to structure thoughts in advance of a meeting, all of which help make the meeting time more productive and efficient.

There are several SaaS tools that help facilitate 1:1 conversations as well. Notable examples include Culture Amp and 15Five. You don't need a tool though; a simple document works equally well. The template I use is available at ctohb.com/templates; it includes prompts for discussing liked/ wished for items at a personal, departmental, and company level, as well as bidirectional feedback between manager and employee.

#### 1:1 Playbooks

Establishing a playbook for these engineering 1:1s is another useful way to make sure these meetings address a consistent set of topics and don't go off track. Your playbook should ensure that your 1:1s touch on the following:

 **Conflict:** Inside your immediate team, across engineering teams, cross-functional

 **Performance and Development:** Often it's your engineers seeking advice on how they can improve something

 **Clarity:** Engineers may have general thoughts about something and are looking for your perspective, or to see if you have different info than they do about something

 **Context:** What's going on more broadly at the company, and how does a contributor's work relate to those goals/objectives

#### Radical Candor

The phrase *Radical Candor* was defined by Kim Scott in her book *Radical Candor*. The book defines Radical Candor as communication that incorporates both praise and criticism, and ensures that the delivery involves both caring personally while challenging directly. I think the point is best made in contrast to three other kinds of communication outlined in Scott's book:

**Obnoxious Aggression:** Sometimes referred to as brutal honesty or front-stabbing, characterized by direct challenge but lack of individual caring, perhaps demonstrated by insincere praise or unkind criticism

**Ruinous Empathy:** Communication that comes from a place of caring personally but lacks a direct challenge **Manipulative Insincerity:** Also known as backstabbing or passive-aggressive behavior, characterized by neither caring personally nor challenging directly

I encourage you to read Scott's book, but if you don't, then at least be aware of these terms and use them as a coaching tool to move your team toward regularly practicing Radical Candor.

### Benefits of Overcommunication

There's nothing worse for an employee than feeling like their manager doesn't communicate enough with them. In the absence of information, it's a natural instinct to assume the worst-case scenario; a lack of information can also be a prime source of anxiety and confusion.

Overcommunication, by contrast, has very few consequences. The worst that can be said of overcommunication is that it can prove a distraction or become redundant, which are problems easily remedied with a bit of thoughtfulness as to the form of overcommunication. It's no surprise, then, that most startups invest heavily in building overcommunication into their culture, often including the phrase as a company core value.

#### EMAIL

Pretty much anyone you interact with nowadays has either been using email for twenty-five years, or since they were in early grade school, so of course this means they know how to use it effectively, right? Unfortunately, effective use of email at work is not necessarily common sense. So, it comes to you to help encourage best practices. Here is some general advice for using email effectively:

* Don't let email become your job.

  * Rather than having email open all day or monitoring it continuously, check email a fixed times each day.
  * Disable email notifications on your phone. Though this one in particular may seem blasphemous, I encourage you to try it. Not only does it significantly reduce the number of notifications you receive, but you'll find yourself building a new habit of proactively checking email when you're ready to engage. is makes email an intentional activity instead of a continual background nuisance.


* Get to inbox zero every day.
  * Invest time in learning your email tool or use optional email assistant add-ons/plugins that help sort and triage email so that, by the end of the day, every day, you'll have zero unread emails.
  * Zeroing your inbox doesn't mean acting on or responding to every email. If you're using email as a to-do list, that's fine (though it's not ideal see Meetings and Time Management, page 28, for better to-do list alternatives); just make sure to triage your email to-do list out of your core inbox so that you won't confuse it with untriaged emails.

* Don't problem-solve in email.

  * Email is a suboptimal medium for having an in-depth discussion, especially when more than two people are involved. Group emails are best used for coordination and overcommunication, not problem-solving.
  * Understand that email tends to lack nuance and tone of voice, which makes intent easy to misconstrue.
  * The temptation to write or participate in a nuanced group email thread is a good indicator that a synchronous conversation is a better forum for addressing the topic at hand. A fifteen-minute discussion can often resolve what an email thread of twenty messages will only scratch the surface of.
  * The act of writing down one's thoughts is often a very productive exercise, but email is not a great way to facilitate and capture that written brainstorming process. Encourage your team to instead write memos in a wiki to facilitate deep thinking.

* Don't rely on email for long or in-depth communication.
  * In general, email is a poor medium for long-form content. Long memos are better put into internal wikis or documentation that can be commented on, updated, and easily referenced in the future.

* Keep emails relatively short ideally, bulleted for key ideas.

  * Don't hesitate to use basic formatting such as bold or highlighting for requests/action items.

* Be mindful of your audience.

  - Engineers in general prefer to be writing code instead of reading/answering email. Ask yourself if an email is really the right way to communicate with your audience. In general, the best method of communication with somebody is *their* preferred method, not yours.
  - It's very easy to leave coworkers off an email thread, either intentionally in an effort not to flood inboxes, or as an innocent mistake. If you're sitting there thinking about which people to add to/remove from an email thread, that's a good sign email is the wrong forum to begin with.

#### SYNCHRONOUS CHAT

Chances are high that your company has already adopted some form of synchronous chat platform; in the early 2000s it was commonly Google Chat or an MSN messenger product, while in the 2020s it's more commonly Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Workspace from Meta. If you're not presently on one of these platforms, it's worth considering their adoption.

The vast majority of companies ranging from day one startups to goliath companies of 100,000-plus have adopted them with great success.

Achieving that success means being mindful and planning around some inherent flaws: synchronous chat programs require both parties to stop what they're doing and engage, and they result in conversations that are poorly organized and do not produce lasting artifacts for your team to reference. You can and should recognize these downsides and compensate for them by setting up basic etiquette and expectations for your team in how to use these tools.

Slack's own blog includes a great article with some common best practices at ctohb.com/slack.

Here are a few recommendations for working with synchronous chat tools:

* Try to include all the necessary information in a message to continue a conversation. If you're asking a coworker a question, provide sufficient context and information in the question to give them the best chance at being able to answer comprehensively. Doing this minimizes the number of notifications sent, reduces the amount of back-and-forth communication, and shortens time to resolution. Tools like loom.com are very helpful for this.
* Use message formatting features, such as bullets and headings, to make longer messages easier to scan and relevant information easier to find.

* Centralize conversations in specific channels or threads. It's unproductive and frustrating to try to follow a conversation with multiple people on more than one topic at a time.

* Lean into notification schedules and do-not-disturb features. You should also encourage members of your team to set up a do-not-disturb schedule in any synchronous chat program to minimize interruptions in focus/flow time.

* In the spirit of overcommunication, default communication to public channels. Even better, establish a culture and standard operating procedure of turning conversations and resulting decisions into long-lived, organized documentation in the company wiki or other appropriate document/information store.

* Be extremely judicious with messages that send notifications to multiple people, e.g., @here or @channel in Slack. Especially as your company grows, the odds are that sending such a message will send a notification and interrupt potentially dozens of employees.


#### ASYNCHRONOUS COMMUNICATION

Asynchronous communication is any communication that is not intended to get a response immediately. To be effective, the receiving party should be able to take their time, process the information, and then reply thoughtfully. A key element of asynchronous communication is that the initial message is a complete thought and contains the necessary context to allow the other party to respond.

A trite example is the dreaded the feature is broken bug report. In nearly all cases, bug reports should go to a ticketing system rather than a direct message. An engineer receiving a bug report in a message does not have the context to know which feature is broken or in what way it's failing to meet expectations. So, the reply from the engineer will likely consist of a handful of questions, requiring more round trips with the reporter, costing time and creating frustration.

Contrast that with a bug report that includes full written reproduction steps as well as a video of a user trying to use the feature and demonstrating the failure. More than likely, this approach will enable the engineer to produce a fix without requiring any further follow-up.

The bottom line is this: any time you send a message to somebody in an asynchronous format, give that person all the information they need so they can understand, process, and reply in a way that advances the conversation.

####  ASYNCHRONOUS CULTURE

You'd be surprised how often well-thought-out asynchronous communication can substitute for a synchronous chat or a meeting. Not only can good asynchronous communication mean fewer meetings and interruptions, but it can also leave behind comprehensive written documentation for others to process in the future. Some startup companies, such as Levels Health, have actually built the idea of asynchronous-by-default into the core of their company culture to great effect (ctohb.com/async).

#### DOCUMENTATION

Documentation is a key element of scaling up your organization. The benefits of writing things down are many: written documentation can assist in onboarding, training, overcommunication, thoughtfulness, thoroughness, building culture, avoiding unforced errors, and more. Your role is not just to believe in the value and ROI of documentation, but to build a culture of documentation and a team that values it.

Some tips for building a culture of good documentation:

* Live the value yourself and set an example for the team. Once I moved a team from writing zero internal wiki articles per week to writing several per day in the course of about eight weeks. Literally the only thing I did to encourage this cultural change was to start writing articles myself. Everything I did that made sense to share with the team I wrote up as an article, and I'd make a point of sharing links to those articles whenever appropriate. Very quickly, other managers started doing the same, and within two months everyone on the team was contributing every week.

* Build documentation both adding to and reading from into your process. Whether it's for onboarding, technical specifications, pull reviews, internal requests for comment (RFCs), or memos, the standard procedure should be to write it down and preserve it in an organized archive in a readily accessible location.

* Develop processes to maintain documentation where appropriate. It's easy for documentation to go stale, and in many situations that's perfectly fine. In others, it's important that documentation stays up to date, and the only way that will happen is if you have a process or checklist that includes updating the documentation. Having a last updated date on every document is a great way to signal to readers that something is fresh or potentially deprecated, stale, or out of date.

* Encourage the team to practice the Boy Scout Rule (always leave the campsite cleaner/code better than you found it). If they find documentation that is inaccurate, they should either update it themselves or explicitly mark the document as deprecated.


One key area of documentation you should pay special attention to is how a developer gets started writing code within a particular project or repository. I recommend every repository have a README.md file that explains a minimum of four things:


**Installation:** How to get the application installed and running locally
**Directory Structure:** How to find your way around this codebase
**Development:** What the develop/run/test loop looks like on this codebase
**Deployment:** How you get your changes into higher environments for this app

#### On Acronyms at Work

Every organization has its own distinct culture, and its own style of internal and external communications. One of a leader's key responsibilities is to make sure that culture always supports the goals of the organization rather than impeding them.

One element of the internal culture of a technical organization that tends to get out of hand is the generation of made-up acronyms that can multiply over time and obscure and over-complicate the communication they were intended to streamline. It may seem like a minor annoyance, but it's symptomatic of poor communications strategy that can spiral out of control, particularly as it can place barriers between those in the know and team members who have no clue what the acronyms stand for. As an organization's technical leader, it's your job to set the tone and define the culture, and although the proliferation of made-up acronyms most likely won't start with you, it's your job to recognize when it's happening and shut it down before it gets out of hand.

In a January 2018 memo to SpaceX employees, Elon Musk called for a No Acronyms policy. I've put that same policy into practice ever since, and I wholeheartedly endorse it. The below came from an email titled Acronyms Seriously Suck (ctohb.com/acronyms):

> There is a creeping tendency to use made-up acronyms at SpaceX. Excessive use of made-up acronyms is a significant impediment to communication and keeping communication good as we grow is incredibly important. Individually, a few acronyms here and there may not seem so bad, but if a thousand people are making these up, over time the result will be a huge glossary that we have to issue to new employees. [...] This is particularly tough on new employees. [...] The key test for an acronym is to ask whether it helps or hurts communication. An acronym that most engineers outside of SpaceX already know, such as GUI, is fine to use. In practice, most acronyms act as a barrier and not a benefit to clear communication. It makes it harder for new employees to understand what's being discussed. It requires effort for a team to maintain a list of acronym definitions someplace, and overall, it's less of a timesaver to both write and speak than it may seem at first glance.*

This may seem blasphemous, or an overbearing and silly rule to try and enforce in a culture. I'm not proposing you punish people for using acronyms or write it on the walls in the halls of your office. Quite the opposite; especially at a smaller organization, it takes only a very light touch to make no-new-acronyms a part of your culture. Get buy-in from your executive team to not create acronyms, and then encourage them to issue a gentle reminder to their managers to do the same, and you'll be amazed how quickly everyone kicks the habit. A sentence or two in your onboarding documentation is often a sufficient nudge for new employees who, due to the gentle note in onboarding and witnessing the lack of acronyms surrounding them, will be far less likely to create them themselves.


### Meetings and Time Management

Broadly speaking, there are three types of meetings: regularly scheduled informational meetings, conflict resolution meetings, and spontaneous/ ad-hoc meetings. Your job as a manager is to set expectations for attendees based on which type of meeting it is. For informational meetings, ask yourself if a meeting is really the best way to communicate the information; sometimes it is, but not always. If it is, make sure the information is communicated in multiple ways, maybe with written materials provided in advance in your company's wiki. If it's a conflict resolution meeting, make sure you've identified the discussion points in advance so participants can come prepared to discuss and work through the issue. Ad-hoc meetings likely have a clearly defined purpose upfront and need no further introduction.

Regardless of the type of meeting, any meeting you set should have a clear objective that is known to invitees in advance. Ideally, everyone will have enough information before the meeting to know if it'll be valuable for them to attend. Just as importantly, your culture should empower people to make the decision not to attend if they judge it not a good use of their time.

#### TIME MANAGEMENT

As a leader at a startup, you'll quickly find your time is split between many kinds of work, and potentially dozens of hours of meetings every week. If you don't yet have a system in place that works for you, now is the time to invest in some good habits and get organized. I recommend both Stephen Covey's *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People* and David Allen's *Getting things Done* as places to start on this journey.

#### MEETING TIMING

One of the ways you can enable productivity in your team is by creating, or allowing for, large blocks of free time for your engineers. Context switching (our tendency to shift from one unrelated task to another) is expensive (see TheMultitasking Myth at ctohb.com/myth), so the more time you can create for engineers to do the work of engineering without switching to other tasks (email, phone calls, meetings), the less total context switching penalty you pay.

I'm a fan of declaring an informal meeting hours window for the team. Encourage the engineering team, and cross-functional teams, to schedule meetings during this two or three hour window every day and try not to schedule engineers outside that window. That leaves a healthy amount of time *every single day* for your engineering team to focus on the core of their work and also make space for necessary informational and conflict resolution meetings. If your team is in more than three hours of meetings per day (fifteen hours per week, nearly half of their time!), you should take a close look at those meetings and ask yourself if they can be consolidated and reduced.

Other teams have found success with no-meeting days setting aside one or more days each week when nobody schedules any recurring meetings. Just keep in mind that, in a forty-hour work week, your goal is to reserve as many of those hours as possible for your engineering team as contiguous blocks of focus time. A single no-meeting day implies an eight-hour block of focus time, but there are still thirty-two other hours to consider, so it doesn't solve the whole problem.

#### ENGINEER'S TIME RECOMMENDATION

Consider this hypothetical week for a software engineer:

* One hour: 1:1 with manager

* Two and a half hours: daily thirty-minute standup meetings

* Two hours: average time spent in other agile ceremonies (sprint planning, retrospectives, etc.)

* Four to eight hours: reviewing others code Four hours: email/chat communication


In total, that's about thirteen to seventeen hours of the week used up for meetings and communication. If you add another few hours on top of that for time spent context switching and unplanned miscellaneous interruptions, quickly you're looking at at best half of a forty-hour work week available for actual focus time. If you're not careful about when meetings are scheduled, then not only will your engineers have only twenty hours left for their core tasks, but also they won't have them in contiguous blocks, further reducing productivity.

I present this contrived example to drive home the point that providing engineers with large blocks of focus time to do engineering does not happen by accident. It's up to you as the leader who determines how their time is spent to develop a culture and process that consolidates and minimizes these distractions and maximizes time available for individual contributors to do actual engineering.

### The HIPPO

HIPPO is a casually used industry acronym, short for Highest- Paid Person's Opinion. Whether you're the highest-paid person or not, your title will imply that you are, and most employees are reluctant to challenge the HIPPO. I strongly encourage you to minimize this effect in discussions by regularly opening the door for challenges, being overtly open to being wrong, and then acting on and championing ideas other than your own. you'll know you're doing this often enough when you feel like you're doing it too often. By the time you feel you're overdoing it, you've probably reached the minimum that most employees need to actually believe you.

In spite of your best efforts to come across as approachable and open to being convinced of other approaches, your presence in a meeting will often still have a subconscious effect on other attendees, especially if they're more than one level below you in the organization chart. Be mindful of this effect and do your best to attend meetings only when you truly add value and the team needs you there. For everything else you can get the notes/ recording after the meeting is over.

#### TO-DO LISTS

In general, to-do lists are a very unsophisticated form of task management, lacking in structure, prioritization, or a time component. I recommend using a calendar-based to-do list. Rather than putting work items in a generic list, slot them in your actual calendar.

This has several advantages. It blocks off dedicated time for actually doing items on your to-do list and ensures you're not overcommitting your time. It allows for prioritization by moving items around, and it also makes it easier to predict when things will get done. Most calendaring systems also have built-in reminder mechanisms that will notify you when you're scheduled to do a particular task.

#### CALENDAR RETROSPECTIVES AND TIME BALANCE

Every now and then say, once a month I encourage you to do a historic review of your calendar and measure how you've spent your time. For example, Google Calendar has built-in analytics and requires only very minimal adaptation of your calendaring habits to provide accurate summaries of how time was spent. When reviewing this data, ask yourself if the ratio of time spent on various types of activities makes sense for the goals you're trying to achieve. It's also good to check in and confirm that you're spending your time in ways that play to your strengths and bring you personal satisfaction. Often just having this kind of data presented matter-of-factly can provide good motivation for organization and productive change.


### Mini Management Frameworks

A lot of the problems you'll encounter as a manager follow common, repeating patterns. Having a mental framework to approach problems can speed up decision-making, improve the quality of your decision-making, and provide context and perspective for explaining decisions to others. Below are some frameworks I've found useful in my management journey.

#### THREE STAGES OF MANAGEMENT PROBLEM-SOLVING

When presented with a large, ambiguous challenge, such as taking over managing a new team, or diagnosing and improving an individual's underperformance, I like to use a three-step process. These steps should be done sequentially to come up with a plan to address a particular problem.

1. Ingest

  * Take in as much information as possible. Read available documentation, be it wiki articles, performance reviews, code, or anything you can find related to your problem. Schedule 1:1 meetings, exercise your active listening skills, and take detailed notes on your findings.

  * You know you've ingested a sufficient amount of data when you start to see the same thing multiple times and you stop seeing new patterns.

  * Example: multiple people comment about a member of your team's performance, and after a handful of sessions of active listening and getting curious, you've stopped getting further new information on the performance issue.

2. Synthesize

  * Once you've collected a sufficient body of data related to your problem, take a step back from collecting information and give your brain time to process. I recommend allocating at least a few days at this stage. Try to deliberately stop taking in new information and spend this time looking at the problem from different angles. Take notes, draw diagrams, play golf, take a shower, or whatever helps you think through the problem and come up with an analysis that fits the data and is actionable.

  * To continue the above example, at this point you might try to come up with various hypotheses for why that individual is underperforming: How are they spending their time? Is it a skills mismatch, an expectations mismatch, or is something going wrong in their personal life, etc.?

3. Act

  * Once you've got a thesis, it's time to actually put a plan into place. When you're taking action, it's important to validate that your plan is achieving the desired results. Whenever possible, test, validate, and if necessary start the loop over again.

#### TEAM-BASED DECISIONING MODELS

 There are three models for developing material for making decisions with your team. As the manager, you can make the material and decisions entirely yourself and present the result as a *fait accompli* to the team. There's also the opposite approach: you start from scratch and entirely codevelop the material with some or all of the team. The third approach is a compromise between the first two: develop a draft yourself and present it as a straw man to the team as a starting point for collecting feedback and iterating to get to a final version. The key differences between these techniques are the amount of time they take, and how much buy-in you get from the team. And I encourage you to optimize for buy-in: ensuring everyone on your team understands decisions and can be a champion for those decisions is the only way to ensure you're all marching in the same direction. As Marty Cagan of Silicon Valley Product Group calls it, you want your team to behave like missionaries, not mercenaries.




 **The Independent Model:** Developing independently as a manager takes the least overall time, but also produces the least buy-in.

 **The Straw Man Model:** Codeveloping decisions starting with a straw man takes a medium amount of time, and depending on execution can produce healthy buy-in.

 **The Codevelopment Model:** Developing collectively from scratch can take a significant amount of time, though it produces the most buy-in from those who contributed to the development.

Which model you use for any given decision is up to you, and I encourage you to be thoughtful and deliberate about that choice. Don't be afraid to revisit it if you feel you've chosen the wrong model.

#### Two Types of Decisions

In an annual letter to shareholders in 1997, Jeff Bezos outlined a framework for classifying decisions into Type 1 and Type 2 decisions. Type 1 decisions are not reversible, and should be thought through methodically, carefully, slowly, and with great deliberation and consultation, Bezos wrote. If you walk through a door and don't like what you see on the other side, you can't get back to where you were before. Which programming language you use, for example, is a Type 1 decision.

Type 2 decisions are the opposite. They can and should be made quickly by high-judgment individuals or small groups. Which exact shade of gray a button is can be a Type 2 decision, as it's easily changed down the line.

Bezos's advice, which I'll echo here, is that using Type 1 decision-making for Type 2 decisions leads to slowness and failure to experiment and innovate.

Most of your day-to-day technical decisions are Type 2 and are best made quickly and revisited or confirmed after you've collected more data via a prototype or MVP implementation. This is because the most expensive element of most startup technical decisions is the engineering team's time invested in the solution. If you deliberately constrain the time (and thus cost) invested into validating a reversible decision, you're out only a small bit. Most Type 2 technical decisions become irreversible only after you've invested considerable time and new engineering on top of them, so be rigorous about evaluating progress early on. When in doubt, make the decision to reverse early.

#### BREAKING TIES

As the leader of your team, ultimately you are accountable for achieving your team's objectives. If the team as a whole fails to meet milestones, that's on you. So, when there is a conflict or disagreement within the team, you need to engage thoughtfully, and then be prepared to make a decision by following one of these three narratives:

1. We'll go with your way because you've made a clear and convincing argument that it's superior.

1. We'll go with my way because it's superior, and I'll explain why using the additional context I have as a result of being a manager with a broader scope of responsibility.

1. We'll go with my way because we can't identify any objective reason why one way is better than another. In other words, it's a tie, and since ultimately I'm the accountable party for success here, we'll go with my approach. I will own the success or failure of this decision.

#### Task Triage The Urgent/Important Matrix

In *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People*, Dr. Stephen Covey offers the Urgent/Important Matrix, adapted from a concept introduced by President Dwight Eisenhower in a 1955 speech. In the Urgent/ Important dichotomy, work is classified by both its urgency (i.e., time sensitivity) and importance (i.e., impact). The result is a four-quadrant chart:


I provide this framework here as a reminder to consider the value of various tasks that arise. The tech leader is regularly bombarded by feature requests, debt to prioritize, defects, etc., and having the perspective to ask whether any given item is important and/or urgent is a very useful and quick triage mechanism.

#### PEOPLE-PUZZLE SOLVER

Much of the work you'll do as a manager is as a people-puzzle solver. you'll have to figure out how to help two people work together productively, or guide somebody to improve on a skill, or design a team structure to enable collaboration. People's behavior is hard to predict and sometimes a team member may say one thing but think or feel another.

In light of this ever-changing complexity, I encourage you to think like a detective or a scientist: always be collecting data. Form a hypothesis of what might happen if you take a given action, take that action, and then collect data on the results. Going through these motions deliberately will encourage you to listen, to witness how people respond in various scenarios. is

in turn will supply helpful data for the next time you're in a similar scenario with the same people.


#### Joining a Team

There are two ways you join a team as a technical leader: either you start on a team in a non-leadership position and grow or are promoted into the role, or you're hired to lead a team. If you're promoted into a role, presumably you have good business context and have demonstrated technical competency but have not yet proven yourself in management and leadership. Conversely, if you're being hired into leadership, you likely have a track record in management but lack context, history, and background on the organization's business, technology, and people. It follows, then, that your approach when starting in the role should differ to compensate for the respective weaknesses.

#### Being Promoted into Management/Leadership

If you're being promoted into a management role and have invested time in developing management skills, or if you have experience and a track record as a manager, then it's likely you won't find this transition very scary, and your goal will be to continue leveling up as a manager. If this is your first management role, however, you'll have a larger mountain to climb.

People management is an entirely new skill set from the technical skills that got you your promotion. Technical skills are of course a prerequisite to being a good technical manager, but they're far from sufficient. Understanding this, and developing the additional skill set that your new role requires, will be key to succeeding as a manager.

If you were promoted from backend engineer writing code in C to frontend engineer writing code in TypeScript, what kind of things would you do? You might read a book on TypeScript, do some TypeScript coding exercises, join a TypeScript user group, read some TypeScript blogs, etc.

Moving from writing C to managing people is actually a larger change than C to TypeScript. Making this transition successfully requires the same level or more of proactive learning. Becoming a great people manager, for most people, is a lifelong journey, and not a skill picked up in a weekend. Embrace the challenge and treat the job as a lifelong learning exercise that starts now.

#### Actionable Management Tips

Keeping in mind German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck's dictum, **Fools learn from experience; I prefer to learn from the experience of others**, here are some actionable tips for new managers:

* Find a management mentor or coach. Talking through people's problems and gaining additional perspective is invaluable. (See the sidebar Find a Management Mentor, page 13.)

* Learn to delegate. *Immunity to Change* by Robert Kegan discusses at length the obstacles to delegation and why learning to delegate is so critical to the success of a manager. The bottom line is that your value to the organization is no longer your own personal output, but that of your team. For many technical leaders, this is the single hardest part of the transition, but it's also the most critical.

* Take care of yourself.
  * Managing people can be very emotionally draining. In order to consistently be your best self, to be level-headed, positive, and productive, it is critical that you take care of yourself.
  * Figure out what works for you; maybe it's meditation, golf, video games, or family time. Do whatever feels good and leaves you refreshed and ready for the next challenge.

  * Pay attention to burnout signs and take a break before it happens. Managing people does not have to be an eighty-hour-a-week activity.

See the recommended reading list at the end of this book to find more resources for developing your management skills.

#### BEING HIRED TO LEAD

If you've been hired to lead a team (as opposed to being promoted into a leadership job or assuming a leadership role as a first-time startup cofounder), presumably you have both technical and management experience. Your challenge as a hired leader of an existing team is to integrate yourself into your new team as smoothly as possible and build trust with your new peers. It should come as no surprise that my advice is to focus more on the people than the technology when managing your new team.

Below, I outline some short-term goals for an externally hired tech leader, plus some questions you should try to answer very early.

Goals:

* Build trust with the technical team. Listen and be thoughtful about when/how quickly you start adding value or changing things.

* Build trust with other teams/leaders, making reasonable commitments and following through on them.

* Learn about the people you're working with and their history with the company/product/technology.

* Diagnose the highest-impact people-specific challenges within the team. Are there staff members who are inappropriately leveled, either underperforming or overperforming their roles? Do any cultural challenges need course correction? Taking decisive action early on to course-correct for culture is a great way to build trust with team members who likely consciously or subconsciously were suffering from the culture issue.

* Diagnose the highest-impact technical problem areas for the team as a whole and put together a set of short-term, medium-term, and long- term objectives for the team.

Questions:

* Who was running technology before? Is that person still on the team?
  * It's common for tech leaders to discover that they want to grow into people management. Where this has happened, you'll be stepping into a people management void. The other common scenario is that either there was no prior tech leader or they ve left the job due to underperformance, and you are inheriting a large amount of tech debt.

* What problem does the CEO say you were hired to solve? What problem do you think you were hired to solve?

* What pain points exist between the technical team and the rest of the company today?
* What pain points are the highest priority within the technical team?

#### Giving Technical Advice to Friends/Strangers

After you've had some form of technical leadership on your résumé for a while, you'll likely start to get friends, or friends of friends, reaching out for advice. For the most part, I recommend taking these phone calls, not only because the networking is valuable, but because the questions you are asked may force you to think through and put words to ideas you're subconsciously working on. They say teaching others is the best way to really learn something yourself.

A quick note on advising non-technical founders: you're likely to get approached from time to time by somebody with a self-pro claimed billion-dollar idea. It costs very little to take these calls and can be a great way to build some social/relationship capital. Be mindful however that brilliant ideas don't themselves make successful businesses. Between every great idea and success is a gigantic mountain of execution, and most climbers are not equipped to summit Everest. So be very careful about making commitments to someone with a good idea and no climbing gear.

#### Traffic: Funnels and Umbrellas

**You can either be a shit funnel or a shit umbrella.** - Todd Jackson, Gmail Product Manager (see ctohb.com/umbrella and ctohb.com/keytogmail)

Questions, concerns, and ideas about your product, absent any strict process for directing them elsewhere, will find their way to management. That includes not just you but everyone in management in your organization. Managers are the default inbox, and the crux of Jackson's statement is that your team is the default outbox. You hear, Hey, There'sa bug in X, and you think, OK, engineer Y wrote that feature, go send them the bug. That would be an example of funneling inbound directly at your team.

A better strategy is instead to act as an umbrella for the team. Rather than directing all the inbound in real time to the team, a good manager organizes, prioritizes, and gives the team a structured queue to work with. Your goal is to help the team focus, limit distraction, and provide a place for where inbound should go so it can be efficiently processed.

Only on rare occasions should you, as manager, highlight a bug to an individual engineer. If you have a bug queue and a process for working through that queue, you can largely eliminate regular one-off escalations.

Management should be monitoring that bug queue process to ensure the queue stays at a manageable length, and adjusting staffing or process if product quality isn't meeting targets.

You should prioritize your queues based on importance and urgency. If something of critical importance with extreme time pressure arises, it should be put into the queue and escalated to the top. Then apply common sense as to how you handle it. If you need to call somebody to ensure they know it's there, then so be it, as long as this is the exception and not the rule.


#### Your First Team

As a technical leader, your job is not just to manage the technical team; it also includes serving as the technical representative in the C-suite. Your role is to represent engineering and technology in all of the company's highest-level strategic discussions and to ensure that engineering and technology are on the right course for the business. At times, this means having difficult conversations with other leaders conversations that require vulnerability and humility, and conversations that enable you to work through conflict and are grounded in mutual trust. These conversations are key to the job, and for them to be possible you must be deeply engaged with your leadership team, thinking of them as your first team.

You're likely a highly technical person. You probably enjoy your technical meetings the most, or at least find solving technical problems with your team familiar and highly satisfying. So, it's easy to fall into a pattern where you spend most of your time with technical teams, and to adopt a my team is the technical team mindset. This is a great way to build rapport within the tech team, and there are times when that is the most critical relationship to invest in.

My guidance is simple: do not let the technical shiny objects distract you or limit your investment in relationships with non-technical leaders. Your relationships with other leaders and your trust with your non-technical peers will give you credibility and enable you to guide the business to making good technical decisions as a whole. Building trust outside the technical team is built the same way any other trust relationship is built: great communication, regular expectation setting by making and meeting commitments, and owning up to mistakes/failures if and when they occur.

The technical leader or CTO who spends all their time deep in code with engineering and barely participates in the leadership team will have little credibility when trying to convince the other C-levels to invest further in engineering. Or worse, they won't even be asked for their input when the time comes to make a hard call. Other leaders will not have the context to understand the value of what the tech team is asking for or the perspective on how engineering is operating at that moment, and they'll lack the shared vision for what it can be in the future. Only by regularly engaging with the rest of the leadership team, sharing that context, and being part of the conversation along the way can you, as the technical leader, ensure that the leadership team has a shared understanding of how engineering helps the organization and how it needs to grow over time.


### Working With The CEO

Every CTO CEO relationship is different, though there are a few elements that are common to all such partnerships, as well as some key prerequisites for a healthy relationship.

#### ALIGNING SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES

The CEO must have complete trust in your ability to lead the technical team to meet business objectives. Building that trust means you need to be able to communicate well with the CEO, both through proactive communication and making sure the CEO always has enough context to ask good questions.

Communicating well means learning to speak business language and avoiding lapses into tech jargon during leadership conversations. You want to empower the CEO to communicate with you, and the more you speak their language (if they are not technical), the more information you can get out of your interactions, and the better the two of you will get along.

#### ALIGNING BUSINESS DIRECTION

You and the CEO need to have a shared understanding of the direction of the business and be able to engage in constructive and perhaps even contentious conversations to ensure the depth of that understanding. Trust applies to overall business direction as well as specific objectives.

There are many ways to build this, but you need to establish trust regardless of the approach you take. Engage in shared non-work activities, find areas where you share personal values, and use specific tools and exercises to build that trust (see Brene Brown's BRAVING Inventory at ctohb.com/braving).

#### ALIGNING CULTURE AND VALUES

As with all C-levels, the CTO and CEO should have strong alignment on company culture and values. It's particularly important that you focus on building a positive culture within engineering, and between engineering and the rest of the company. The technical team is often a very large if not the single largest line item in a startup company's budget. Technical staff are also often the most competitive roles to hire for, making recruiting and inevitable involuntary employee turnover more expensive in engineering than in other departments.

Strong alignment between the CTO and other C-level executives on culture and values is a key factor in ensuring the technical team feels respected and included in the company, which should in turn help with retention.

### Delivering Bad News

One general piece of advice for working with other leaders or executives is to not shy away from delivering bad news to your fellow leaders, especially the CEO. Since you are accountable for the performance of the team, you may be tempted to sugarcoat reality, to advertise that everything is fine. The problems with this approach are numerous:

* If things are not fine, meaning deadlines are consistently missed or quality is falling below expectations, your peers will know that and will wonder why you're not owning those failures and explaining how you'll improve. is disparity between reality and how you're representing it undermines trust in your leadership.

* From time to time, you'll need to make time for the software engineering team to do non-user-facing engineering as an investment, either in tech debt or future architecture. you'll need to have the trust of other leaders and the credibility so that others believe you and understand the ROI on that time.

See the Principle section of Chapter 1 of Jocko Willink and Leif Babin's *Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win* for more on the importance of owning failure.

### Speaking the Language of Your Audience

Technical topics are often highly nuanced; the details matter. Technical jargon does a great job at helping to convey that nuance, so it's no surprise that when engineers explain technical subjects they often use language that is unintelligible to members of other departments. I'm sure you've witnessed the over-eager engineer trying, with energy, passion, and excitement, to explain their project to a non-engineer only to be met with a blank stare and no new shared understanding being created. As a technical leader, you must do better.

If, for example, you have a major area of tech debt and you want to advocate within the executive team for taking an entire month to re-architect that area of code, you need to communicate your reasons in a comprehensible way. If you enter that conversation discussing latencies, RPC calls, dependency injection, and acronyms from your cloud service provider, chances are your CEO and CFO will tune you out almost immediately.

If, on the other hand, you frame that conversation around developer productivity and team morale, and explain the debt paydown in the context of team velocity over the next six months, your argument will be much more convincing.

### Technical Communication Best Practices

A few general tips for ensuring more successful discussions and presentations particularly with non-engineers when talking tech:

Establish a shared language/vocabulary upfront. If you need to use any words the average high-school student wouldn't understand, make sure that your audience already knows them, or clearly define them before launching into the explanation.

Use relatable concepts. Technical challenges are often compared to other technical challenges: that does not work when talking to non-technical staff. Rather than describing your slow data transfer in bytes per second, compare it to traffic on a highway.

Confirm understanding along the way. Ask questions of your audience during your explanation. If they can say the punchline before you then you know you're on the right track.

Don't assume you are in any way superior due to your mastery of technical language, or worse, make your audience feel inferior for their lack of knowledge. I don't want to get too technical for you is a great way to turn off an audience.

In general, try to keep your explanations as simple and concise as you can. Avoid going down rabbit holes that might be a distraction or otherwise disengage your audience.
