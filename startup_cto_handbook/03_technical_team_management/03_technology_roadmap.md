## Technology Roadmap

### Timeframes

I find it useful to think of a technology roadmap in three timeframes, sometimes labeled as short-, medium-, and long-term or horizon one, two, and three. Each timeframe should be managed by a different process and is often owned by different stakeholders.


#### Short-Term/Horizon One

Your short-term roadmap is what your team is working on now. is includes any in-flight features, actively worked-on defects, tech debt, or urgent work items. For more detail on managing your short-term roadmap, see Workflow in the Tech Process section, page 157.


#### Medium-Term/Horizon Two

If you're the only technical manager on the team, then you are responsible for both the medium- and long-term roadmaps. If you have directors or senior managers reporting to you, you'll likely be collaborating on the medium-term roadmap. The medium-term roadmap is a very useful artifact not only for your own planning and organization but also as a tool to communicate with other departments/stakeholders on what the engineering team is doing.

Typically, a medium-term roadmap is implemented as a spreadsheet where teams or individuals are rows, and columns are time periods often weeks or sprints and the contents of the table are high-level work items or work areas. The purpose of the roadmap is not to predict precisely when any given task will be completed; doing so would require accurate and precise estimates of work which is tenuous at best (even at a granularity of weeks) and never a guarantee. Instead, the idea is to outline an order of operations and set a direction for the team.

You can and should expect to update the actual duration of any given activity as engineering progresses. Updating the number of weeks on a given task is a great point in time to evaluate whether continued investment in a project makes sense, and also to update external stakeholders on current completion estimates. Finally, the roadmap is helpful as a retrospective tool for tracking how long major initiatives took, and also to assess where a team is investing time at a very high level.

#### Long-Term/Horizon Three

As the leader of your team, it falls on you to focus on the long-term health and productivity of the team. You should spend time designing these goals and producing a well-thought-out, clear document (or slide deck, video, wiki article, etc.) that explains the goals to the team. Once you've set initial goals, revisit them infrequently as changing strategic goals causes churn in an organization. Just as problematically, frequent changes in direction can be confusing and demotivating for the team. I encourage you to provide an update on progress towards long-term initiatives on a quarterly basis, both to the entire engineering team as well as to other executive leaders.

Some examples of long-term initiatives:

*Architectural tech debt*

- Moving from a deprecated framework to something actively maintained
- Migrating from one hosting environment to another (e.g., onboarding to Kubernetes)

*Language debt*

- Consolidating usage of programming languages
- Moving from older to newer versions of languages (Python 2 to 3, or .NET 4 to .Net 5+)

*Platform/architecture adoption*

- Having multiple teams adopt or migrate to new versions of internal services
- Moving to/from serverless environments
- Adopting new paradigms (e.g., server-side rendering, edge computing)

*Hiring plans*

- Growing or reorganizing teams
- Hiring specialists or building new technical departments

#### Timeline Communication

Every leader in sales, marketing, product, or support I've worked with has been appreciative of transparency in the technical process and technical roadmap. By contrast, I've spoken to leaders at some companies who describe their technical teams as a black hole. It goes without saying that you don't want to be called a black hole. Not being a black hole is simple; it looks like somewhere in your organization having a regular process to provide transparency to other leaders. Ideally, you're also helping other departments feel heard by having a forum, or a mechanism, to take input and incorporate that into the roadmap process. You can also close the loop and your process communicates back to stakeholders where their request is in the development process and manages expectations for when it will be ready.
