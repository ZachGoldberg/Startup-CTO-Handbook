# Glossary

**Agile ceremony**: Agile ceremonies are meetings where a development team comes together at various stages during the development process for discussions on planning future work, communicating ongoing work or reviewing and reflecting on past work.

**Applicant Tracking System (ATS)**: An applicant tracking system (ATS) is software for recruiters and employers to track candidates throughout the recruiting and hiring process.

**Boy Scout Rule**: Leave things better than you found them. As applied to a technical team, whenever you work in an area of code, always make even a small improvement, maybe to tests, or documentation, or otherwise improve clarity, readability or maintainability.

**Brownfield development**: e opposite of greenfield development: working with existing legacy systems, often heavily impacted by tech debt. You're stuck with the high-level decisions that have been made in the past and you have limited flexibility for large change.

**Business Intelligence (BI)**: Business intelligence (BI) is software that ingests business data and presents it in user-friendly views such as reports, dashboards, charts and graphs.

**ClickOps**: ClickOps is the error-prone and time-consuming process of having people click-through various menu options in cloud providers websites, to select and configure the correct automated computing infrastructure.

**Containerization**: Containerization involves packaging software that contains all the necessary elements to run an application into a container environment. is allows organizations to run applications from anywherein a private datacenter, public cloud or even a personal laptop.

**Context switching**: Changing from one task to another. For engineers that means setting aside the problem being worked on and starting to work on another. The act of switching is generally time consuming and less efficient than working on one problem at a time.

**Direct report**: Direct reports are employees who report directly to someone who is above them in the organization chart, often a manager, supervisor, or team leader.

**Engineering Product and Design (EPD)**: e idea of combining together into a single department what traditionally has been three separate departments: Design, Product and Engineering. The order of the acronym is often changed, EDP, PDE.

**Greenfield solution**: Greenfield software development refers to development work in a new environment with minimal pre-existing legacy code and free choice on tools, patterns, and architecture.

**Horizon One/Two/Three**: Each horizon represents a different timescale. Horizon one is generally short term (days/weeks), two is medium (months) and three long term (years). Often used as a planning tool to ensure you're accommodating each horizon.

**Idempotent**: A technical operation is idempotent if subsequent executions of the operation do not change the output.

**Kaizen**: Kaizen is the philosophy of continuously improving all processes in an organization.

**Key Performance Indicator (KPI)**: KPIs are the critical quantifiable indicators of progress toward an intended result. Sometimes referred to as input metrics.

**Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)**: Objectives and key results is a goal-setting framework, originating at Intel in the 1970s, used by individuals, teams, and organizations to define measurable goals and track their outcomes.

**Pigeonhole principle**: Describes a circumstance where there is a fixed number of outcomes and a larger number of trials. If you flip a coin three times then at least one of heads or tails must come up twice.

**Product Requirements Document (PRD)**: A PRD is a document that gathers into one place the background, references, justification for and articulation of the requirements for a product.

**Reproducibility**: The ability to reproduce a given outcome on demand. Generally in software development it takes the form of a user pushes button X, then the application crashes. If pushing the button is a complete and reliable description of how to cause the application crash then this is a reproducible crash with understood reproduction steps.

**Request for Comment (RFC)**: A document that outlines an idea, philosophy, proposal or methodology that is intended to collect feedback and ultimately become a long-lived reference material.

**Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**: An approach, and generally a document, that attempts to dig below the superficial to truly understand why an event occurred. Generally used as an investigative tool, and then reference documentation, for why an incident occurred in a software project.

**SaaS Management Platform (SMP)**: A SMP provides a single location to review, manage, optimize and govern SaaS tools used across an organization.

**Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**: e phrase Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) originated in the 1990s and is used to refer to some fairly specific technology choices. Nowadays, the phrase is used to more broadly describe a system where information moves between parts of the system over a network

**Standup meeting**: (aka Daily Scrum ) A regular meeting as part of the scrum/agile ceremonies. Generally intended to be short, less than 30 minutes, to facilitate communication, updates, conflict resolution and decision making within a team.

**Straw Man Model**: A first draft proposition that can be put together rapidly with incomplete data. Often used as a starting place proposal with a team to accelerate the process of collecting feedback and getting to a solution.

**Synchronous/Asynchronous Workplace Culture**: e idea of an asynchronous workplace culture is that communication flows are encouraged to asynchronously, that is, without needing both sides of the communication to participate at the same time. For example, a written document facilitates asynchronous communication, the author need not be present when the readers consume the document. Asynchronous cultures de-emphasize meetings and emphasize written or recorded audio/video documentation.
